Debating Judging Manual
A note about the authorship of this manual
The World Universities Debating Championships WUDC or Worlds Debating and Judging Manual
was initially compiled in advance of the 35th World Championships in Malaysia Before that in the
three and a half decade history of Worlds there had not been a single authoritative document 
beyond the WUDC Constitution which specified how debating and judging takes place at the World
Championships 
This Manual is the product of the time work wisdom and effort of many adjudication cores and debating
intellectuals and academics

3 Debating Judging Manual
Introduction Rules and Guidance
This manual is divided into three chapters Chapter One explains the fundamental format and operation
of debates in the British Parliamentary BP format used at Worlds The main chapter Chapter Two 
explains how judges should evaluate debaters and consequently how debaters ought to debate Chapter
Three offers some additional notes for judges covering issues like how the deliberation process works 
speaker marks giving feedback some pitfalls to avoid and so on 
Ultimately everything in Chapters One and Two of this manual can be divided into two sorts of
statements Rules and Guidance Rules are obligatory requirements of BP debating most of which are
found in the WUDC Constitution breaching these rules is impermissible though in many cases the
infraction might be small not especially reprehensible and easily remedied Many rules strictly prohibit
certain practices for instance it is not permitted to offer a point of information POI later than six
minutes into a speaker s speech A very small number of such breaches of the rules offering a POI after
six minutes speaking for longer than 7 minutes and 30 second or bringing props into a speech may
require intervention by the Chair of the debate though ideally swift and minimal intervention to stop the
speaker breaching the rules the chair may for example instruct the maker of a POI or the current
speaker to sit down and stop talking We call these breaches of order 
Other rules handle how a Chair should assess features of speeches in determining the relative
persuasiveness of teams Many of these are found in seed form as Constitutional rules but have been
developed by long standing practice and common acceptance into complexes that have elements of both
rules and guidance Examples include appropriate handling of failures to take POIs consideration of
off putting stylistic features and assessment of whether an argument has actually been logically
persuasive Breaches of these rules will rarely if ever require any intervention by a Chair instead they
are considered in the judge s assessment of how persuasive a speaker was when it comes to adjudicating
the debate In other words the rules specify what can and cannot be done in debaters efforts to win
debates They are not optional though in the vast majority of cases violations of them are small mistakes
and should be treated as such rather than being deemed an outrageous attempt to cheat 
At several points this manual makes statements which are not rules but guidance we have tried to
always be explicit in stating that something is guidance rather than a rule Guidance is general advice on
how to succeed in debating For example it is sensible if you want to be persuasive to structure your
speech in certain ways to explicitly label your points and to use examples from a range of different
cases for instance But one doesn t need to do any of these things to be persuasive or win a debate and
there is no reason why someone who labels their points should necessarily be deemed any more persuasive
than someone who doesn t Explicitly labelling points will usually help a speaker convey their argument to
the judges but there may be other ways to do this or circumstances in which explicit labelling is
unnecessary Guidance thus constitutes general advice from the authors of this manual to debaters or
judges much like the tips or advice a coach would give which they are free to follow or abandon as they
wish 
Crucially a team should never be penalised in the judging of a debate for failing to follow any guidance
offered in this manual simply because it s the guidance offered in the manual Put another way 
judges have to judge how persuasive teams are according to the rules not how well the teams follow our
guidance 
4 Debating Judging Manual
1 Core Rules of BP Debating
1 1 BP Format
Each debate will contain four teams each team consisting of eight speakers 
There are two teams on each side of the debate On one side are Opening Government OG and Closing
Government CG on the other side are Opening Opposition OO and Closing Opposition CO 
The two sides of the debate are sometimes called benches as in the Government bench and the
Opposition bench The first two teams in the debate OG and OO are sometimes collectively called the
 opening half whilst the third and fourth teams in the debate CG and CO are sometimes collectively
called the closing half 
Government Bench Opposition Bench
Opening Half Opening Government OG Opening Opposition OO 
 Prime Minister PM Opposition Leader LO 
 Deputy Prime Minister DPM Deputy Opposition Leader
 DLO 
Closing Half Closing Government CG Closing Opposition CO 
 Government Member GM Opposition Member OM 
 Government Whip GW Opposition Whip OW 
In the order specified below speakers from the four teams give their speeches with each speaker
giving one speech 
1 First speaker the Prime Minister from the OG team 
2 First speaker the Leader of Opposition from the OO team 
3 Second speaker the Deputy Prime Minister from the OG team 
4 Second speaker the Deputy Leader of Opposition from the OO team 
5 First speaker the Government Member from the CG team 
6 First speaker the Opposition Member from the CO team 
7 Second speaker the Government Whip from the CG 
8 Second speaker the Opposition Whip of the CO Team 
5 Debating Judging Manual
The debate is presided over by a Chair a designated individual who oversees the proceedings of the
debate calling on speakers to speak and enforcing the rules At Worlds the Chair will usually be one
of the judges the individuals who will ultimately decide the result of the debate In the Grand Finals
of the tournament the Chair might be a designated Master of Ceremonies or another designated
individual not judging Each debate will also usually have a timekeeper who could be the Chair 
another judge or another individual entirely who times speakers speeches 
1 2 Length of Speeches
Speeches last for 7 minutes Time signals usually a bang on the table ring of a bell or clap of the hands 
will be given by the timekeeper to indicate when 1 minute 6 minutes and 7 minutes often indicated by a
double clap bang have elapsed Though speakers should ideally finish their speech by 7 minutes they
may legitimately continue to speak in order to finish their sentence or wrap up a conclusion As a general
rule this shouldn t take more than a further 15 seconds Beyond 7 minutes and 15 seconds judges are no
longer permitted to take anything the speaker says into account The Chair or timekeeper of the debate
should bang the table or clap three times at 10 second intervals after 7 minutes 15 seconds to remind the
speaker that they are now well beyond their time limit If the speaker continues speaking past 8 minutes
 which should never happen the Chair of the debate should call order and instruct the speaker to sit
down 
Speakers should start their speech within 1 minute of being called on by the chair of the debate unless in
reasonable circumstances as approved by the chair 
1 3 Roles of the Four Teams
Each team has a role to play in the debate and the speakers from that team should attempt to fulfil
that role effectively 
a OG should define the motion advance arguments in favour of their side and rebut arguments
made by OO 
b OO should rebut OG s case i e the general set of arguments they have offered and advance
constructive arguments as to why their side of the table should win the debate 
c CG should provide further analysis in favour of the motion which should be consistent with 
but distinct from the substantive material advanced by OG Further analysis can take the
form of substantive material refutation framing characterization or any kind of material
meant to advance the Government case 
d CO should provide further analysis against the motion which should be consistent with but
distinct from the substantive material advanced by OO Further analysis can take the form of
substantive material refutation framing characterization or any kind of material meant to
advance the Opposition case 
More details on these roles can be found in Chapter 2 
1 4 Points of Information
A Points of Information POI is a formalised interjection from any speaker on the opposite side of the
table to the speaker who has the floor It is up to the speaker who has the floor to decide which POIs to
accept i e allow to be made or reject i e not allowed to be made 
6 Debating Judging Manual
The first and last minute of each speech is known as protected time during which no POIs may be
offered to the speaker who is making their speech During the intervening 5 minutes i e between 01 00
and 06 00 points of information may be offered 
Teams should take at least 1 POI per speaker and are strongly encouraged to take 3 POIs across the
team including at least 1 POI from a team on their diagonal eg CO taking POIs from OG 
A POI may last up to 15 seconds It can take the form of a comment or a question to the speaker who has
the floor To offer a POI a speaker should if they are able to stand and say point of information on
that point or point They should not offer coded POIs by uttering anything which reveals the
content of the POI before it has been accepted by saying for example on the law or not at all If
the POI offered is refused the speaker who offered it should sit down immediately 
POIs may not be offered after the 6 minute mark in a speaker s speech and at 6 minutes all speakers
currently standing to indicate that they have offered a POI should sit down It is acceptable for a POI
which was offered and accepted before the 6 minute mark to continue to be made past the 6 minute mark
 it should continue until the POI is concluded the 15 second time allotment has passed or the POI is cut
off It is also acceptable for a POI offered before 6 minutes to be accepted by a speaker dead on the 6
minute mark and then be made Once all speakers are sitting after the 6 minute mark no more POIs may
be offered or accepted 
Speakers may demand that certain speakers or teams stop offering POIs but it should be of no effect in
the mind of the judge or other debaters all debaters have the right throughout the times the rules allow
in the debate to offer POIs to speakers from the other side Similarly a speaker calling for a POI to be
offered does not create any special obligation for a team or speaker to offer a point 
Considering POIs in Judging Engagement
POIs are an important component in debate rounds It is the responsibility of judges to track and evaluate
POI engagement during the round which includes but is not limited to whether or not a speaker was
offered POIs whether or not a speaker accepted a POI the quality of the POI asked as well as the quality
of the POI response If a speaker has not accepted a POI judges must remind the room to accept POIs
after the speaker has finished speaking Judges should also comment on POI engagement during their
feedback to teams and will be evaluated on this metric in judge feedback forms 
When evaluating speakers that have not taken POIs assuming sufficient POIs were offered judges should
see a failure to take a POI as indicative of a reduced level of engagement and should take this into
account when determining the call For instance judges can lower speaker scores for the speaker that did
not accept POIs to reflect their reduced level of engagement adjust the margin of victory for teams or
flip close calls between teams This DOES NOT mean that a team will take an automatic fourth for failing
to take a POI NOR DOES IT MEAN that they cannot win the debate 
If a speaker was offered no POIs or was only offered one or two POIs at the start of their speech and had
no opportunities to take POIs towards the later half of their speech they will not be penalized for a lack
of engagement After all it is difficult to engage when there is nothing to engage with A speaker in
such circumstances may explicitly ask for a POI and doing so will demonstrate a willingness to engage
with arguments even if no POI is subsequently offered 
7 Debating Judging Manual
Failing to take a POI has sometimes been suggested to be equivalent to taking a very damaging POI 
this is not an appropriate way to assess this failure A judge should never give teams credit for
arguments that they have not made 
In general judges should evaluate the quality of POIs and POI responses in the same way that they
consider any other piece of argumentative or responsive material in the rest of the debate 
Cutting off a POI
Interrupting a debater who is giving a POI is known as cutting off POIs may be up to 15 seconds in
length however a speaker may cut off a POI before 15 seconds and resume their own speech Whenever
a debater delivering a POI is cut off or their time elapses they must stop speaking and sit down If the
person offering the POI does not stop speaking after 15 seconds or after being cut off the judge should
intervene by calling order 
If a POI is cut off before 15 seconds has elapsed the judge should assess whether this cutting off was
legitimate If the POI was cut off before the point could be clearly made it may be appropriate to treat
the speaker as though they had not taken the POI This is because speakers cannot meaningfully engage
with POIs if they do not allow their opponents sufficient time in which to ask the POI 
Barracking Badgering
After a POI has been offered to a speaker and rejected by them another POI should not be offered
within the next 15 seconds by any debater Persistently breaching this rule i e continuously offering
points of information to a speaker in quick succession is known as barracking or badgering This is not
permitted as it is disruptive to the debate and unfair to the speaker 
POIs do not initiate a dialogue Once the POI has been made cut off the debater making it sits down 
They must wait the required time and offer a new POI if they wish to interrupt the current speaker
again The only exception to this is if the speaker was unable to catch the POI and asks the offeror to
repeat or rephrase their question or comment In this situation the debater asking the POI may stay
standing and repeat their question or comment 
Points of Clarification
Debaters sometimes offer points of information with the phrase point of clarification usually to the
Prime Minister s speech to indicate that they wish to ask a question about how the Prime Minister is
setting up the debate rather than make an argument This is permitted but points of clarification
otherwise function entirely as any other point of information Speakers are not obliged to take a POI just
because it was labelled as a point of clarification Taking a point of clarification does count as taking a
POI because it is a POI Points of clarification have no special status in the rules whatsoever speakers
offering a POI are simply allowed a special exception to use the label point of clarification when
offering these types of POI 
A Point of Clarification should only be used to clarify various aspects of the model Points of Clarification
should not be used as a way to ask Points of Information 
8 Debating Judging Manual
1 5 Before the Debate
The Motion
Each round has a specific topic known as the motion The motions are set by a team of senior judges at
the tournament known as the Adjudication Core also known as CA Team or AdjCore for short The
Adjudication Core will announce the motion for each round of debates along with the draw showing all
the rooms in the tournament and the positions in which each team in the competition will be debating in
each room to all participants 15 minutes before the debates begin If debaters are uncertain about the
literal meaning of a word in the motion they may ask a member of the Adjudication Core to define it for
them They may not ask anyone other than a member of the Adjudication Core to explain any words in
the motion nor may they refer to online resources They may also not ask for any further assistance from
the Adjudication Core beyond a simple definition of the word they are unfamiliar with 
Information Context or Definitions accompanying motions
On some occasions the Adjudication Core may release an informational slide or infoslide prior to
releasing the motion This usually consists of a short explanatory paragraph which can serve several
purposes from simple clarifications of words in the motion to giving context and relevant information
about potential issues in the debate 
Information provided in the infoslide should be assumed to be true for the purposes of the debate
following it For example if the extra information comes in the form of a definition of a word or term in
the motion this definition should not be disputed in the round following it However teams are free to
provide additional definitions clarifications or contextual information during the debate on top of
whatever information is already provided within the infoslide 
Preparation Time
After the motion is released teams have 15 minutes to prepare their speeches During these 15
minutes the two speakers in a team must confer solely with each other while preparing Receiving
assistance from anyone else during prep time such as coaches other members from their institutions or
judges is strictly prohibited teams spotted doing this should be reported and may be penalised by
disqualification from the tournament1 Teams must not under any circumstances use the Internet to
research the motion or to communicate with anyone that is not the CA team the Organizing Committee 
or their partner However they may use their electronic devices as stopwatches or as cameras to take
photographs of the draw motion and info slide They may also refer to electronic offline dictionaries 
1We hope that no team at Worlds breaches these strict prohibitions However if you are a debater and you witness another
debater preparing with someone other than their partner or illegitimately using electronic devices you should report this to a
member of the Adjudication Core or if they are not available to any Chair judge or if no Chair judges can be found to any
other judge A judge informed about this should try to visually confirm that the team in question is indeed illegitimately
preparing with outside assistance illegitimately using electronic devices ideally they should also get another judge to witness
this They should then ask the team to provide their team name and explain that preparing with someone other than your
partner using electronic devices for purposes other than timing or as an electronic dictionary is strictly prohibited They should
then either immediately or after that round of debates is completed inform a member of the Adjudication Core about the
issue 
9 Debating Judging Manual
There are no exceptions unless teams receive authorisation in advance from the Equity team as
authorised by the Adjudication Core due to special circumstances such as an access need 2
During the 15 minutes of preparation time Opening Government may prepare in the venue that will be
used for their debate Other teams observers and judges should not enter the room until the preparation
time is over 
Judges should call debaters into the debate room 15 minutes after the motion is announced Teams must
be ready to enter the debate room once the 15 minutes has elapsed Late teams risk being replaced by a
 swing team a special ad hoc team created to replace them which is not a fully participating team at
the tournament which will be summoned if they are not ready to enter the debate room after 15
minutes of preparation time If the summoned swing team has reached the debate room and the debate
has begun before the actual team has arrived then the actual team will not be allowed to participate in
the round and will receive zero points for that round 
Pronoun introductions
Before the debate begins each of the participants in the room will be invited to introduce themselves
and also be given the opportunity to introduce a gender pronoun 
There is no requirement to express a particular pronoun Chairs should make this clear when they
facilitate the introductions of both speakers and adjudicators 
For example chairs might say something like 
 Before we start this debate we will go around the room and introduce ourselves At that
time you are welcome to state your pronoun preference if you wish to do so If you do not
want to state a pronoun that is ok and in that case everyone else please defer to gender
neutral language 
As a result if you do not feel comfortable disclosing a pronoun or do not have a pronoun you wish to
disclose you may simply state your name and speaker position as your introduction 
If you do wish to state a gender pronoun an example for doing so is 
 Hello my name is my gender pronoun is 
As the chair introduces each speaker the chair can remind the room of the speaker s pronoun if
applicable For example the chair might say 
 I now invite the government member x pronoun they 
All participants should take note of the pronoun of each speaker and use that pronoun to refer to them
 if applicable You should not assume anyone s gender pronoun 
If you mistakenly use the wrong pronoun please apologise Disregard for a person s gender pronoun may
be treated as an equity violation 
2For the avoidance of doubt this authorisation does not include use of digital matter files or online communication such as google
docs 
10 Debating Judging Manual
If a speaker or an adjudicator does not introduce a pronoun all other participants in the room should
use gender neutral language e g speaker or Prime Minister or adjudicator 
1 6 Iron personing
If during any of the Preliminary Rounds a member of a team is taken ill and requires medical treatment 
or a recognised medical condition prohibits them from participating in a given Preliminary Round the
other member of the team is entitled to participate in the Preliminary Round as an iron person team In
an iron person team one speaker delivers both speeches The speaker must prepare on their own In
judging an iron person team the Adjudication Panel shall treat the team as if they were an ordinary
team and fill out the ballot accordingly indicating that the team was an iron person team on the
ballot 
The rules relating to iron person teams shall operate at the discretion of the Adjudication Core and
Equity Committee Where there is a dispute between the two bodies regulating iron person teams the
judgement of the Equity Committee shall take precedence 
From the perspective of other teams in the debate and the judging panel this team of one speaker
giving both speeches functions just like a normal team they may receive any rank in the debate from
first to fourth and will receive two speaker marks one for each speech and other teams in the debate
will be awarded the other ranks as normal In the tab the tabulated results for the tournament 
maintained round on round and used to determine the break however the absent speaker will receive
zero speaker points and the iron personing speaker will receive a single speaker score the higher of the
two speeches they gave 
The iron personing team may keep the team points that they received during the round and these team
points will be used to determine the draw for future rounds Teams may still break as long as they are not
speaking as an iron person team for more than 3 preliminary rounds out of 9 
1 7 Breaches of Order
For the debate to be able to proceed properly and for all speakers to have a fair chance to deliver their
speeches all debaters and anyone else in the debate room are required to refrain from disrupting the
debate Any of the following activities are considered to be disrupting the debate 
 Barracking badgering
 Continuing to offer a POI after being cut off by the speaker speaking or by the Chair
 Offering POIs in any way other than those described in Section 1 4 when not delivering a
speech or a POI
 Speaking beyond 7 minutes with a 15 second grace period
 Talking in an audible volume or otherwise generating distracting noise during another
speaker s speech
 Engaging in other highly distracting behaviour
 Using props any physical object diagram etc 
 Receiving any external communication during a given speech e g notes passed to the speaker
from their teammate 
11 Debating Judging Manual
These are not only breaches of the rules and or appropriate debate conduct as it is commonly understood
but are also breaches of order Unlike other breaches of the rules which simply damage a team s chance
of getting a good result in the debate breaches of order should be enforced by the Chair of the debate
by calling order 
Calling Order
When the Chair of a debate utters order it is a demand that all speakers immediately cease any of the
breaches of order listed above This should not happen often Provided debaters adhere to the call to
order no further action is taken A Chair should never call order for a breach of the rules which is not a
breach of order 
Stopping the Clock
In exceptional circumstances the Chair is entitled to clearly say stop the clock in which case the
current speaker should immediately halt their speech and the timekeeper of the debate should pause the
stopwatch being used to time speeches This measure should only be used in response to severe obstacles
to the debate proceeding which need to be addressed urgently and cannot wait for the current speaker to
finish their speech for example one of the debaters or judges fainting or suffering a medical emergency 
or a severe and persistent disruption to the debate such as a constantly heckling audience member a
technical failure in sound equipment that might be being used in the debate and so forth 
In any such instance the key objective of stopping the clock is to protect the welfare of all those involved
in the debate and to allow the obstacle to the debate proceeding to be dealt with as swiftly as possible
 this may involve abandoning the use of any sound or recording equipment having someone take an ill
debater for medical attention removing an unruly audience member from the room and so forth This
will only very rarely be necessary in response to a breach of order and is more commonly required due
to an external interruption to the debate Once this has been done the Chair should check that the
speaker is ready to resume the speech call for the clock to be restarted and allow the speaker to
continue their speech from the point at which the clock was stopped 
1 8 Tournament Structure
The World Universities Debating Championship is structured in two halves see the diagram below The
larger bulk of the tournament usually taking place over the tournament s first three days consists of a
number of preliminary rounds often termed in rounds in which all debaters at the tournament take
part historically there have been nine such in rounds Most of these rounds are open meaning that
teams find out the results of the debate and receive feedback from judges at the end of each round 
The final few rounds however are closed results and feedback are not immediately given to speakers 
but can be obtained from judges once the break see below has been announced 3
After the in rounds the best performing teams in the tournament advance to a final set of knock out
rounds often termed out rounds whilst the remaining teams do not this process is known as the
break Teams are ranked in order according to the total team points they have accumulated over the
in rounds 3 points for each first placed finish in a debate 2 points for a second placed finish 1 point for
3This postponement in giving the results ensures that teams do not arrive at the break with sure knowledge of whether they will
advance to the knock out stages or not 
12 Debating Judging Manual
a third and 0 points for a fourth with teams tied on total team points ranked according to their total
 speaker points a mark out of 100 each speaker on the team receives for their speech in each room At
current Worlds 48 teams progress through to the Open Break for which any team at the tournament is
eligible usually 16 teams progress through to the ESL Break for which only teams with two ESL or EFL
speakers are eligible and usually eight teams progress through to the EFL Break for which only teams
with two EFL speakers are eligible Currently a team that is eligible to more than one break can indicate
in advance to which break it wants to proceed Open ESL or EFL yet it cannot participate in more than
one break Those teams that make it into the three breaks then participate in three separate knock out
draws progressing towards an Open Final ESL Final and EFL Final the winner of which becomes the World
Champion in that category 4
4This is assuming that the constitutional requirements for these breaks are met the WUDC Constitution requires a minimum
number of ESL and EFL eligible teams participate in the tournament for each stage of ESL or EFL finals to be included If for
example a smaller number of ESL teams are present the ESL break may only be to Semifinals eight teams if a larger number
are present the break may be expanded to include Octofinals 32 teams 
13 Debating Judging Manual
2 Debating and Judging at WUDC
2 1 Winning a Debate
Teams in a debate are all aiming to win the debate For both debaters and judges the central
statement on how teams win debates is as follows 
Teams win debates by being persuasive with respect to the burdens their side of the debate is
attempting to prove within the constraints set by the rules of BP Debating 
There are two important comments to make about this central statement 
 i One could stand up in a debate and be persuasive about anything but this will not help to win
a debate unless it is relevant to the burdens teams are seeking to prove 
 ii The rules of debating constrain legitimate ways to be persuasive For example in the absence
of rules the Opposition Whip could often be very persuasive by introducing entirely new
arguments but the rules prohibit this As such elements of a speech can only help a team
win a round if they are both persuasive and within the rules 
2 2 The Ordinary Intelligent Voter 
In most walks of life persuasiveness is highly subjective the degree to which we are persuaded by
something reflects our existing beliefs our personal aesthetic or stylistic preferences our particular
interests and so forth It would be problematic if debating was judged so subjectively outcomes would
hinge as much on whom the judges were as on the debaters performance with one side of the debate
becoming much harder to win from because the judges were predisposed to disagree with it 
Consequently as far as is humanly possible judges assess the persuasiveness of speeches according
to a set of shared judging criteria rather than according to their own views about the subject
matter In particular judges are asked to conceive of themselves as if they were a hypothetical
 ordinary intelligent voter sometimes also termed average reasonable person or informed global
citizen 
Facts Knowledge and Special Language
The ordinary intelligent voter has the sort of knowledge you d expect from someone who regularly reads 
but does not memorise the front pages and world section of a major international newspaper like the
New York Times or the Economist in the year leading up to WUDC They do not read technical journals 
specialist literature or the like They are in short a smart person who has a good deal of knowledge that
is broad rather than deep Imagine a bright and reasonably well read university student who is studying a
subject completely alien to any topic that would help them understand the debate in question 
Debaters may certainly make reference to examples facts and details the ordinary intelligent voter is not
aware of but they should explain rather than cite these examples facts and details While they may not
know much on a specific topic by some debaters standards the ordinary intelligent voter is genuinely
14 Debating Judging Manual
intelligent and understands complex concepts facts or arguments once they re explained Where such
examples are not explained beyond name checking a country judges should discount material they do
understand that the ordinary intelligent voter would not Judges should be bold in applying this rule it is
unfair on other teams in the room not to 
Importantly the ordinary intelligent voter comes from nowhere not where a particular judge comes from 
So there are no domestic examples requiring less explanation for the ordinary intelligent voter even
where everyone in the room comes from that country Wherever you are from assume your judges are
from somewhere else 
Following on from the above the ordinary intelligent voter does not know technical terms that one would
require a particular university degree to understand They can be assumed to possess the sort of
generalist vocabulary that comes from a university education of some sort but probably not from your
specific degree They do not have the sort of halfway there economic or legal jargon that we as debaters
have become familiar with either Saying Laffer curve to most people is equivalent to making some
clever sounding noises Similarly using terms like economic efficiency will lead to their being
understood only as a layperson would grasp them losing any technical specificity Judges should judge
accordingly and speakers who wish to make use of the extra specificity that technical terms convey
should take the time to explain the connotations of the terms they wish to use 
Dispositions
This hypothetical ordinary intelligent voter doesn t have preformed views on the topic of the debate
and isn t convinced by sophistry deception or logical fallacies They are open minded and concerned
to decide how to vote they are thus willing to be convinced by the debaters who provide the most
compelling case for or against a certain policy They do not judge debates based on their personal
beliefs or political convictions nor do they enter a debate thinking that one side is indefensible 
As described in the section above they are well informed about political and social affairs but lack
specialist knowledge They are intelligent to the point of being able to understand and assess
contrasting arguments including sophisticated arguments that are presented to them but they keep
themselves constrained to the material presented unless it patently contradicts common knowledge or is
otherwise wildly implausible 
Judging as the Ordinary Intelligent Voter
As can perhaps already be intuited from the above paragraphs the ordinary intelligent voter is quite
unlike most or perhaps any real world people But the concept of the ordinary intelligent voter is a
useful way of revealing a set of important characteristics that judges should aspire to in order to ensure
that all teams receive a fair hearing in any debate As such the term ordinary intelligent voter 
describes the expectation that judges should 
 be aware of basic facts about the world e g Syria is in the Middle East would be considered
basic 
 be familiar with issues and events that have made international headlines for a sustained period of
time e g judges should be aware that COVID 19 is a pandemic and has had a severe impact on
many countries They should be expected to know that different countries had different models of
response to COVID 19 with some countries deprioritizing the economy and implementing
lockdowns and some countries prioritizing keeping the economy open and relying on individual
15 Debating Judging Manual
social distancing They do not necessarily need to be aware of the specifics of individual models
each country has implemented 
 avoid utilising personal knowledge that they have of the topic unless it could reasonably be
assumed to be held by someone who fulfills the previous two criteria 
 give little credit to appeals merely to emotion or authority except where these have rational
influence on an argument 
 avoid presuming a geographic cultural national ethnic or other background when assessing
arguments 
 avoid preferencing arguments or styles of speaking that match personal preferences 
 assess the merits of a proposed policy solution or problem separate from any personal
perspectives in relation to it 
This does not mean that speakers cannot make complex claims about complicated issues based
on their own specialized knowledge or indeed that judges cannot be convinced by these claims 
While judges should be assumed to have ordinary knowledge about various issues they should also be
fully capable of logically following and analyzing a debate and understanding complex concepts
when explained If teams wish to bring in their own specialized knowledge to the debate they must
be able to explain them in a way that is free of jargon and understandable by the ordinary intelligent
voter 
Thinking as the ordinary intelligent voter does not absolve us from our responsibilities to actually judge
the debate to evaluate the logical flow of arguments determine the extent to which teams have
seemed to win them and ensure that they have done so within the rules We should not say while that
was clearly irrational rabble rousing the ordinary intelligent voter would have fallen for it This not only
leads to irrational conclusions but also generally overestimates how much cleverer we are than an
ordinary intelligent voter 
We emphasise that a key reason for judges to imagine themselves as the ordinary intelligent voter is to
avoid relying on their subjective tastes as well as their subjective beliefs Many of us debate a lot and
we develop aesthetic preferences about speaking as well as in jokes and references which we find
terribly funny This is natural but distracts somewhat from debating As voters we are much less likely to
credit policies for being advocated in a sophisticated or funny way 
Judges should remember that they are not aiming to evaluate who was cleverest neatest or funniest but
who best used their cleverness neatness and funniness to persuade us that the policy was a good or a
bad idea 
2 3 Persuasiveness
Judges judge debates by assessing without prejudice which team in the debate was most persuasive 
The persuasiveness of an argument in BP debating is rooted in the plausible reasons that are offered to
show that it is true and important which we term analysis or matter and the clarity and rhetorical
power with which these reasons are explained which we term style or manner 
It is crucial to understand that in BP debating analysis and style are not separate criteria on which an
argument is assessed In particular BP debating does not consider it possible for an argument to be
persuasive merely because it was stylish There is nothing persuasive in speaking a sentence clearly and
powerfully if that sentence is not in fact a reason for an argument And equally reasons for an argument
16 Debating Judging Manual
that cannot be understood by a judge cannot persuade them Good style is about conveying a speaker s
analysis of arguments effectively to the judges Style and analysis thus do not independently generate
persuasiveness but describe the necessary collective elements that make an argument persuasive The
fact that we discuss them below in separate sections should not detract from this 
Analysis
The analysis behind an argument consists of the reasons offered in support of it Reasons can support
arguments in a number of different ways none of which is in itself better or more important 
Reasons might explain why arguments are true by 
 presenting empirical evidence for an argument 
 giving mechanistic links for why a certain outcome will come about 
 identifying widely shared moral intuitions in favour of an argument 
 exposing a damaging logical implication of a contrasting argument 
 identifying an emotive response that encourages us to care about a certain outcome 
 or doing various other things that encourage the ordinary intelligent voter to believe that an
argument is true and important to the debate 
Reasons themselves may be stronger or weaker according to a number of important criteria including 
 the precision of what the speaker says and 
 the detail with which relevant logical claims empirical evidence causal processes moral
intuitions logical implications or other elements are explained 
Beyond these ways of identifying reasons within a speech that support arguments the speaker is making 
judges deploy very minimal standards in assessing the degree of support a reason gives whether the
reason itself is plausible and whether it therefore makes the speaker s argument persuasive Seriously
implausible claims such that any ordinary intelligent voter would not believe its logic and or premises 
provide weak if any support for an argument 
Certain things do not matter in themselves in evaluating how good a speaker s analysis was 
 the number of arguments the speaker makes 
 how clever innovative the argument was 
 how interesting the argument was 
 arguments that you re aware of but which weren t made 
What matters once an argument is made is how important its conclusion seems to be in the debate with
respect to the burdens that each side is trying to prove and the extent to which it seems to be analysed
and responded to and how well it withstood or was defended against such responses Judges do not
consider how important they thought a particular argument was in the abstract but rather how central it
was to the overall contribution of any team or teams in this particular debate and how strong the reasons
speakers offered to support the claim that it was important unimportant were 
17 Debating Judging Manual
Style
Arguments can be stylistically impressive in a range of ways crucially good style should not be
equated to the sort of style admired in my debating circuit culture Speakers do not have bad style 
because they don t speak with the particular idioms mannerisms coded references or established
phrases used in the country their judge is from Crucially judges must not discredit arguments because
of the style or accent in which they were delivered and will be in breach of Equity should they do so 
Above all else a strong accent is not bad style Everyone in the world has their own particular accent 
and they all have their own accent strongly When people talk about mild or strong accents they mean
how strong or mild the accent is compared to the accents with which they are familiar This sort of
subjective measuring is not a valid basis for judging certain styles as superior There is only one legitimate
way accent can be a problem for a speaker at Worlds and that is if judges genuinely cannot understand
what the speaker is saying despite their very best efforts to do so This is a problem in the same way that
speaking too fast to be understood is a problem judges have to understand the words a speaker says in
order to evaluate them This is a problem that could afflict any accent in principle it is not just a
problem for an ESL or EFL accent Worlds is an international tournament and speakers may find
themselves judged by people from any nation There is thus an obligation on all speakers to make
themselves comprehensible to all judges and a burden on judges to do everything they can to understand
a speaker s words and meaning The tournament aims to be as inclusive as possible to speakers of all
languages but Worlds is inescapably an English language based competition5 If judges cannot despite
their very best efforts understand an argument they cannot find it persuasive 
So as suggested one basic point underpins the judging of style at Worlds there is wide global variation
in what makes for an aesthetically pleasing style and subjective judgements of good style should not
carry any weight in judging BP debating at an international tournament But this does not mean style
is irrelevant Worlds sets down a minimal number of principles to guide effective style that we take to be
of fundamental and international applicability As already noted good style is about conveying reasons
effectively 
Reasons are thus more compellingly delivered to the degree that 
 They are comprehensible 
As noted the speaker s claims must be comprehensible to the judges to be evaluated Technical
jargon without explanation speaking so fast you are incomprehensible speaking so quietly you
are not audible slurring words or fragmented sentences could all make an argument impossible
to understand and therefore could be unpersuasive To be clear judges must make a dedicated
effort to understand the speaker to the best of their ability and must not automatically dismiss
speeches as incomprehensible 
 They clearly and precisely convey the speaker s meaning 
5WUDC welcomes the establishment of partner World Championships in other languages of which the Campeonato Mundial
Universitário de Debate en Español World Universities Debating Championship in Spanish is a pioneering example 
18 Debating Judging Manual
Vagueness ambiguity and confusing expressions necessarily make judges uncertain over the
nature of the reasons the speaker is offering and how they support the speaker s argument The
more clearly and precisely speakers can convey their reasoning the more persuasive it is 
 They effectively convey the emotional moral practical or other significance of the speaker s
claim 
The key question a judge should ask themselves is Is there additional information being conveyed
via this stylistic choice If yes then the rhetoric has amplified the effect of the logical analysis 
and should be credited as making the argument more persuasive If no then the rhetoric has not
been effective in conveying the significance of the logical analysis and should not be credited as
making the argument more persuasive 
Additional characterization illustration and framing that emphasize the logic being presented can
all contribute to the persuasiveness of the argument Word choice phrasing complexity of
language intonation and other stylistic choices are not credited in isolation They are only
credited insofar as they meaningfully add to your arguments for instance using delta to
replace the word difference does not meaningfully alter the content of your speech 
It is tempting but wrong to think that arguments in debating can be assessed through pure cold 
emotionless logic unaffected by language or tone Making and assessing arguments is impossible
unless one attaches a certain significance to outcomes principles or claims and appropriate use of
language and tone can convey such significance 
It is crucial to note here that rhetoric cannot replace logical analysis but rhetoric can amplify the
effect of your logical analysis Persuasive rhetoric does not necessarily need to be complex so long
as it communicates the significance of your point 
To reiterate arguments cannot be persuasive just because they are stylish Rather style and analysis must
work together to make an argument persuasive 
2 4 Contradictions
Teams on either Government or Opposition should not contradict themselves or their bench partners 
Besides being unpersuasive inconsistency is unfair to opposing teams It cannot be reasonably expected
from a debater to answer two contradicting lines of argumentation especially if those are given in
different times during the debate 
What is a contradiction 
A contradiction is explicitly stating and taking a position opposite to one that is already made by your
side advancing claims that are mutually exclusive to the claims that have been advanced by your
opening team your partner or earlier in your own speech 
A contradiction is not a statement that is clearly pre argumentative or mistakenly said i e something
that can be deemed pre argumentative lacking the sufficient surrounding words to be a reason to
19 Debating Judging Manual
support or not support the motion which appears to contradict an argument that the speaker their
partner or their closing member subsequently makes This is to avoid teams being unduly punished for
a speaker mis speaking and or saying something otherwise inconsequential 
Contradictions within the same speech or within the same team
Teams cannot be credited for two mutually exclusive claims They may only be credited for the first
claim they have advanced Subsequent claims which contradict or cannot coexist alongside the first claim
should not be credited by the judges and opposing teams This is due to the fact that internally
inconsistent teams
cannot simultaneously get credit for two areas of mutually exclusive argument 
In addition to not crediting contradictory claims judges may also consider the extent to which the
contradiction has undermined the strength of the team s arguments when determining the team s
contribution to the debate If either the speaker or the team directly contradicts themselves later in
their speeches this undermines their own points and should be taken into consideration during
deliberation when determining how plausible their argument is similar to as if an opposing team offered
these arguments in refutation to the speaker While the later claim should be disregarded judges should
evaluate how the contradiction affected the persuasiveness of the first claim 
However judges should not credit opposing teams unless they point out the contradiction 
If a speaker clearly mis speaks at the start of their speech and they correct it afterwards they should
not have the rest of their speech discounted simply because it contradicts what they said first Other
than the instance of clear mis speaking by the speaker the argument made first should be considered to
be the stance of the team and later arguments that contradict the first argument should be discounted 
Contradictions between teams on the same bench
It is important to note that contradictions or refutations of an opening team s claims by their own
closing team should not be considered when determining the strength of Opening s arguments or their
level of persuasiveness 
Arguments made by a closing team that directly contradict their opening team s arguments should be
ignored by the judge i e the time spent by the closing speaker contradicting their opening team is
equivalent to the speaker saying nothing at all 
This is to ensure that all teams in the debate are treated fairly as closing teams have a rules based
obligation to stay consistent with their opening teams This also ensures that debates are coherent and
that teams are not forced to defend opposing claims or respond to contradictory cases 
Making an even if argument along the lines of even if OO were wrong about this we re going to show
that this motion should still be defeated does not constitute knifing However as with any other
extension an even if extension will not provide good grounds for a closing team win unless it improves
the bench s persuasive position 
20 Debating Judging Manual
How teams should deal with contradictions from the other side
It is good practice for teams to point out contradictions if they exist in the other side s case including
between the two teams on the opposing bench Whenever there is a contradiction teams should
consider the first claim to be the version they must engage with 
By way of example OG offers 2 claims which are mutually exclusive claims A B Claim B the later
one should not be credited by judges when evaluating the contribution of OG however claim B can still
weaken the persuasiveness of claim A When engaging with OG other teams should consider claim A to be
the line of argumentation OG pursues i e Opposition should respond to it and CG must be consistent
with it See Section 2 9 for issues relating to definitional challenges 
2 5 Rebuttal Engagement and Comparisons
The outcome of the debate should depend on what the teams say Judges must not intervene in the
debate Do not invent arguments for teams do not complete arguments and do not rebut arguments 
Engagement from closing half teams should not benefit their opening e g closing half rebuttal should not
influence the pairwise comparison between Opening Government and Opening Opposition 
We do not automatically dismiss arguments just because we disagree or because we can see weaknesses
in them Arguments are persuasive and impactful once they are made and substantiated they become
less persuasive and impactful if they are contradicted internally or responded to by other teams 
This has an important implication if OG for instance make arguments where the conclusion is we should
do the policy and every other team ignores those arguments then OG does not lose because the debate
moved on from them Rather their unrebutted arguments should still be treated as impactful and should
be weighed as such That does NOT mean that the unresponded to arguments have a particular effect on
the ranking of OG in this example Judges still need to consider how significant an argument is before
deciding how it affects the ranking of teams in a debate 
If an argument is clearly absurd such that you cannot conceive of any Informed Global Citizen believing
its logic and or premises or it was of marginal importance to the speech of the speaker making the
argument then it is reasonable for a responding team to decide to spend their time elsewhere 
particularly where there is other stronger material in the round Furthermore judges are entitled to
assess how well substantiated an argument is an argument that is just an assertion as we d all agree 
language constructs reality without any subsequent substantiation should not receive much credit 
There is no absolute duty for a speaker to hit every argument from the other side However it may be
advantageous for other teams to point out and respond to weakly constructed arguments If major claims
go unchallenged by teams this should be counted as conceded by the team which has passed up the
opportunity to respond 
Rebuttal consists of any material offered by a speaker which demonstrates why arguments offered by
teams on the other side of the debate are wrong irrelevant comparatively unimportant insufficient 
inadequate or otherwise inferior to the contributions of the speaker s own side of the debate Rebuttal
need not be explicitly labelled rebuttal though it may be sensible for speakers to do so and it may
occur at the beginning end middle or through the entirety of a speech Material labelled as rebuttal can
be constructive as well as rebuttal and material labelled as constructive can also function as rebuttal 
21 Debating Judging Manual
Rebuttal does not therefore denote some special sort of argument or analysis it simply refers to
any material that engages directly with arguments raised by the other side 
Where teams have a chance to rebut each other assessing relative contributions in this way is easy 
Judges should track the argument and assess given their responses to each other which team s
contribution was more significant in furthering their cause to logically persuade us that we should do the
policy or that we should not 
But where teams don t get a chance to rebut others determining who was more persuasive is trickier 
This happens fairly often for example 
 between teams on diagonals
 when the Opposition Whip explains something in a new way
 when opening teams are shut out of POIs
In these circumstances judges are forced to perform some more independent assessment of the arguments
made Judges will have to assess not only which arguments are most important but also which ones are
most clearly proven Arguments that require the judge to make numerous logical leaps are better than no
arguments at all but are not preferable to a well reasoned argument that rests on fewer unsubstantiated
assumptions 
Assessing arguments will also involve a comparison with existing material within the debate For instance 
when judges compare two teams on a diagonal for example OG and CO they should first ask whether
anything in the earlier speaking team s case is inherently responsive Did the opening team preempt any
material within their case construction or their substantives Did the later speaking team being assessed
deal with the stronger parts of the opening team s case or merely the weaker parts Check whether they
allowed the diagonal team in on POIs to give them an opportunity to engage Deliberately shutting out
engagement from a team whose material is relevant is often obvious and very unpersuasive 
Crucially in these instances judges must not make new arguments for top half teams they may only
reasonably interpret and apply existing contributions 
2 6 Burdens
As stated earlier there is no value in being persuasive about an argument that is irrelevant to the
debate In assessing what contributions are relevant it is helpful to consider the burdens a team has to
meet in the debate 
Burdens on teams cannot be created simply by another team asserting that they exist and judges should
not accept these assertions if they are not backed up by analysis Teams and judges should not push
unrequired burdens onto their opponents Moreover even if a team fails to meet a burden that does not
mean that they automatically lose the debate Judges should consider analysis advanced by teams even if
that analysis does not necessarily meet the burdens in the debate 
However there are two key ways that a burden can legitimately be attributed to a team and speakers
may legitimately point out such burdens and explain why they or other teams need to meet them 
22 Debating Judging Manual
First a burden may be implied by the motion itself If for example the motion is This House would
prioritise the vaccination of law abiding citizens in the case of major epidemics government teams need
to demonstrate that in major epidemics the vaccination of law abiding citizens should be prioritised 
Government teams do not need to demonstrate that vaccinations of law abiding citizens should be
prioritised in general outside of major epidemics or that only law abiding citizens should be vaccinated
 law abiding citizens should simply be prioritised The way OG defines the motion see below may affect
these burdens however Opposition teams need to demonstrate that Government are wrong that the
policy of prioritising law abiding citizens for vaccination in major epidemics should be opposed They do
not necessarily need to show that law abiding citizens should not be prioritised in any way under any
conditions though the fact that we do prioritise law abiding citizens in other cases might be used as
evidence of a principle that supports prioritising law abiding citizens in this case 
Second burdens can also be set by specific analysis teams take up For example if the motion is This
House believes that assassination is a legitimate tool of foreign policy the Opposition Leader may
initially argue that assassination is a severe breach of international law For this to be relevant to the
debate OO have a burden to show that illegality matters for illegitimacy This burden is especially strong
if the Deputy Prime Minister then states that they accept that assassination is illegal but argues that
illegality is a poor basis for believing an act illegitimate Unless Opposition teams now provide superior
reasons to think that the illegality of an act under international law is a reason to deem it illegitimate it
is not relevant to the burdens they need to prove to merely keep pointing out that assassination is illegal 
or provide more detail on how it is illegal Both sides now agree that assassination is illegal and
continuing to agree with this achieves nothing What the sides now disagree on is the implications this
has for assassination s legitimacy and it is this which they have a burden to prove 
Weighing competing frameworks
As evidenced by the above examples teams will often dispute the criteria by which the round should be
adjudicated on and argue that points should be judged according to certain frameworks and standards 
This is permitted teams are allowed to debate what criteria should be used to assess whether a policy is
good as part of arguing that it is in fact good 
Judges should adjudicate this debate about criteria they should not just apply their own preferred
criteria They should adjudicate this on the following basis 
 Is there one criterion or principle that all teams explicitly agree is true and important E g all
teams explicitly agree that their goal is to save the most number of lives and the debate is about
the best way to do so
 If not is there one criterion or principle that all teams implicitly agree is true and important E g 
while no team explicitly articulates that their goal is to save the most number of lives all the
analysis advanced by teams points in this direction
 If not is there one criterion or principle that one team in the round has successfully proven to be
true and important I e If no team agrees on one criterion and all teams are asserting different
metrics which team has provided the best reasons to believe that their metric is the most
important one in the round 
 Where none of these apply judge based on what the Ordinary Intelligent Voter would take to be
important This should be a last resort measure only as it is very rare that none of the
aforementioned scenarios would apply 
23 Debating Judging Manual
One common form of this mistake is to assume a utilitarian what leads to the best consequences 
framework This should not be assumed without a team presenting supporting arguments for doing so It
is also wrong to disregard principled argumentation explaining that particular effects are more important
than others for reasons unconnected with utility maximisation So judges should listen to teams 
arguments about what our aims and principles should be and evaluate the claims of harms or benefits in
that context This can make the claims about how we should determine the right policy particularly vital 
and they may fundamentally reshape team s burdens in the debate 
For example if in the debate This House would invade North Korea Opposition successfully proves that
 war is always wrong regardless of the practical benefits they must do more than assert it 
Government will likely now need to offer reasons to believe that a practical calculus is relevant if they
want to advance purely practical reasons in favour of the invasion 
Judges should generally be wary of considering an argument completely irrelevant because of a principled
framework advocated by their opponents It is very unlikely that any team will ever prove their view of
the appropriate criteria to be completely and undeniably true and that consequently arguments which do
not fit those criteria should be completely dismissed out of hand It is thus often more appropriate to
treat arguments as less persuasive when they rest on criteria which another team have suggested are
not relevant rather than ruling them out completely 
2 7 Motion Types
Motions can come in a few different guises often hinted at by the words used to introduce the motion
 This House would This House believes that This House supports and again this can affect
the burdens teams face Adjudication Cores do not use these openings so consistently that we can set
hard and fast rules on what they tell us about the motion but here are some general guidelines 
Policy Motions
Motions of the form This House Would do X involve Government arguing that they should be enacting
policy X A policy is a concrete course of action that Government teams wish to convince the judges
should be implemented Such motions are about whether the House should do X with Government teams
arguing that they should and Opposition teams arguing that they should not These debates are purely
normative They do not require teams to discuss whether or not policy X is likely to be enacted in the
real world or whether or not policy X is currently status quo 
For the purposes of the debate the Government teams are the government and the politicians that make
it up and the debate is about whether they should or should not do a policy not whether their real world
counterparts will or will not It should be assumed that the policy will be implemented in the manner
that the Government teams set up also known as Government fiat As such it is never a valid line of
opposition to such motions to state that but the government would never do this or more subtly but
politicians would never pass this law 
Take for example the motion THW ban cigarettes The debate should assume that the Government
team has the power to implement such a policy and that this policy will therefore pass the approval of
Congress or Parliament however the Government team cannot control reactions to this policy and
cannot assume that everyone will behave in a compliant manner once the policy is passed The question
of the debate is whether or not the policy should be enacted in the manner that the Government team
24 Debating Judging Manual
has set out not just about whether or not cigarettes are good or bad It is perfectly possible for the
Opposition team to agree that cigarettes are bad but oppose the policy of banning cigarettes altogether 
For Policy motions Opposition teams may choose to defend status quo or propose an alternative in the
form of a counter proposition see section 2 10 It is not necessary for Opposition teams to present a
counter proposition though it may be beneficial in some instances 
If presenting a counter proposition Opposition teams are granted the same amount of fiat power that
Government teams have the debate should assume that whatever counter proposition Opposition
proposes will also be implemented and it would be similarly futile to argue that Opposition s
counter proposition would never be passed by any parliament in real life However it is crucial to note
that Opposition s counter proposition should not take significantly more resources to achieve than
Government s policy More information can be found in the section on counter propping 
Analysis Motions
Motions that begin with This House believes that X are value judgment debates They require
Government teams to argue for the truth of the statement represented by X whilst Opposition teams
argue that X is false There is no need for Government teams to implement a model 
Take for example the motion THBT there is no moral obligation to follow the law The debate is
about whether or not the statement is true not about whether or not the government should do
anything about the statement by for instance abolishing all laws which is in any case implausible 
Government teams need not have a model they should however still define terms within the debate 
In this case they should define what a moral obligation is 
Motions that begin with THBT X should are about whether or not the statement is true from the
perspective of a neutral observer Even though these motions are phrased as true or false statements 
Government teams are encouraged to implement a model 
Take as an example the motion THBT the US should sanction Saudi Arabia While it is possible for
teams to debate the merits and demerits of sanctions in abstract the debate would be made much
clearer if Government teams present a model outlining what sanctions entail what kinds of sanctions
would be implemented and so on Similar to policy debates Opposition may also propose an alternative
 see Section 2 10 on counterpropping These motions should not be confused with actor motions 
discussed in the section below 
Motions that begin with This House supports opposes X also usually need not involve Government
proposing a model Instead the Government teams need to argue that they would either symbolically 
politically materially or in some other manner support the person group institution cause idea value 
or statement expressed by X Opposition need to argue that X should not be supported in that way 
Take for example the motion THS US involvement in the Middle East Government teams must argue
that US involvement is positive in totality without picking and choosing which aspects of this motion
they are supporting Similarly Opposition teams must oppose this motion in totality without picking and
choosing what to oppose Teams cannot support only favorable aspects of US involvement nor can
they oppose only unfavorable aspects of US involvement 
25 Debating Judging Manual
Secondly Government cannot model how US involvement will occur They can argue that US involvement
is likely to happen in a certain way but this characterization is open to challenge by the other teams 
In other words Government has no fiat power in THS THO debates 
Motions that begin with This House prefers function in the same way as other analytical debates with
one important difference Opposition teams are bound to defend the specific comparison provided by the
motion They must either 
 In motions phrased THP X to Y defend Y or
 In motions phrased THP X defend status quo 
For example in the motion THP the conscription by lottery as a means of enrolling people in the army
to aggressive recruitment of volunteers Government must argue that conscription by lottery is
preferable to aggressive recruitment of volunteers and Opposition must argue that aggressive
recruitment of volunteers is better than conscription by lottery 
In the motion THP conscription by lottery as a means of enrolling people in the army Government
must argue in favour of conscription by lottery Opposition must argue in favour of army enrollment
policies as they are in the status quo They cannot argue in favour of abolishing the army or reducing
enrollment in the army remember Opposition is bound to defend the specific comparison in the
motion 
Debaters should be aware that there is a unique version of THP motions which are phrased THP a
world in which X These types of motion set a burden on Government to envision and argue in favour of
the alternate world described in the motion As in all other types of THP motions Opposition is still
bound to defend the status quo or whatever comparison is presented in the motion 
In the motion THP a world in which organized religion does not exist Government needs to
conceptualize an alternative world without organized religion This motion is also backwards looking it
requires teams to consider how the world would have developed had organized religion never existed 
Here it is reasonable to expect the debate to contain some discussion of how the trajectory of human
history or development would have been impacted This is similar to how counterfactuals work in THR
motions see section below on Regrets motions 
As these debates require the conceptualization of an alternative world arguments about transitions
between the status quo and the alternative world are not permissible For example using the previous
motion teams should not discuss backlash from the demise of organized religion as organized religion
would have never existed in this alternative world 
Debaters should also use their common sense to determine the point at which this new world diverged
from the status quo For example some motions mention the introduction of a new technology It would 
in most cases be unreasonable for teams to assume that this technology existed 2000 years ago It would
be more reasonable to assume that this technology was recently introduced Similarly in the motion
 THP a world where Hillary Clinton won the US Presidential Election it should be clear that teams are
meant to discuss the election of 2016 when she was the Democratic nominee and not for instance the
election of 1800 or even the election of 2012 
Motions that begin with This House Regrets X ask whether the world would have been a better place
without the existence of X In this debate all teams are debating with the benefit of hindsight the
26 Debating Judging Manual
harms or benefits that teams are attributing to X have already occurred i e status quo Teams must
also describe how an alternative world that developed without X occurring would look like This is also
known as a counterfactual For example with the motion This House Regrets the selection of Joe
Biden as the Democratic nominee teams cannot just debate the merits or downsides of Biden as a
Democratic nominee Instead they should consider who alternative Democratic nominees might have
been and whether those nominees would have led to better or worse political outcomes than in the
status quo 
Actor Motions
Motions that begin with This House as A would do X 6 are somewhat special These motions are
more specific about the entity A doing X and so invite a closer examination of the perspective of the
entity about what they should do with all teams arguing from actor A s perspective Teams debating
these motions should therefore consider what actor A s knowledge values and interests are and explain
why the motion is or is not in actor A s best interest Unlike previously discussed debates7 actor debates
are not about whether or not X action is necessarily best for the world 
It is important to note at this point that prioritizing actor A s perspective is not the same as assuming that
actor A only cares about their own interests Most if not all actors hold moral beliefs and principles and
will act to actualize those beliefs Thus debaters should feel free to make principled arguments in actor
debates in addition to more practical arguments so long as they are also able to explain why the actor in
question holds those specific principled beliefs 
Additionally what an actor should do is different to what the actor is likely to do For example whilst
past statements of intent help us to understand an actor s perspective this does not mean they could not
be persuaded to follow a different path 
So if for example the motion is TH as a parent would not send their child to private school this
debate should take place from the perspective of a parent as both the proposed agent to make a decision
about the education of their child and the proposed target of argumentative appeals By contrast if the
motion is THBT parents should not send their children to private schools the motion does not take
place solely from the perspective of the parent instead the debaters are simply trying to convince the
judges of the truth of the statement from a neutral perspective In such a debate Government teams
would first have to explain what the interests of a parent are and then explain why not sending their
child to a private school meets those interests The interests of the parent can be practical e g wanting
6A motion worded This house would should be treated as an actor motion if it contains an Information Slide describing the
perspective of an actor commonly starting with the wording You are a For example You come across a button which if
pressed will instantly and painlessly erase all of human existence If not pressed immediately the button will permanently
disappear This house would press the button 
7Some analysis motions may be worded This house believes that X is in the interests of Y These motions are likely to feature
similar and in some cases identical arguments to actor motions 
The main distinction between these motions is that by virtue of their motion type they will necessarily enliven different burdens 
For example in an actor debate Opening Government can model how the actor would do X 
Additionally in an actor debate there may be more argumentation open to teams about the moral beliefs and principles an actor
holds whereas in the alternative motion wording teams may need to more explicitly analyse why those moral beliefs and
principles translate into interests 
Finally it is possible there are rare cases where the actor s interests from their own perspective and the actor interests from a
neutral observer s perspective diverge slightly For example this could be in circumstances where the neutral observer has
additional information that the actor does not themselves have and could not realistically be able to obtain 
27 Debating Judging Manual
their child to succeed materially in life or principled e g a broad interest in the principle of equality 
Opposition teams can do two things they can either agree with Government teams about the interests of
the parent and argue that the proposed course of action does not meet those interests or they can argue
that parents have different interests than the interests raised by the Government team and that this new
set of interests can be better met by sending their child to private school 
2 8 Role Fulfilment
Role fulfilment in brief is the name given to the particular duties given to each team on the table 
arising because of their particular position beyond the general duty to make persuasive arguments 
Some such duties exist to ensure fairness by specifying additional constraints on the debaters to reflect
the idiosyncrasies of BP debating as a method of persuading an ordinary intelligent voter 
A debater who gives an excellent fifteen minute speech or submits a persuasive essay or a set of visual
aids will not be entitled to credit for doing so regardless of how persuasive these would have been in
conveying their reasons for affirming or rejecting the motion Doing so involves breaking the rules and
cannot entitle them to credit Role fulfilment is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a team to
make persuasive arguments Incomplete role fulfilment should not be used as the sole justification to
fourth teams 
The duties associated with role fulfilment are as follows 
 For the Prime Minister to ensure the debate is adequately defined see Section 2 9 
 For the Member speakers both Government and Opposition to extend the debate explained in
section 2 8 
 For all speakers to ensure that their arguments are consistent with all other arguments made
by themselves their teammates and the other team on their side of the debate see Section
2 4 for more information on contradictions 
 For all speakers to take at least one point of information during their speeches and to offer
points of information on a regular basis see Section 1 4 on POIs 
 For all speakers to speak within the time frame allotted see Section 1 2 on speech timing 
We emphasise here that there is no such thing as an automatic fourth or any automatic penalty for a
failure to comply with the rules in this document A team that breaches an element of role fulfilment
may still be sufficiently persuasive to beat other teams in the debate particularly but not exclusively 
when multiple teams in the debate have role fulfilment issues 
It is not a role fulfilment requirement for the Deputy Prime Minister or Deputy Opposition Leader to add
new material whether arguments analysis rebuttal etc to the debate OG and OO teams are within
their rights to concentrate all their constructive arguments within their opening speeches and leave the
Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Opposition Leader to reiterate reconstruct reword or summarise the
Prime Minister or Opposition Leader s contributions this is not breaking the rules and judges should
not punish teams for doing this in and of itself But such a strategy may be inadvisable Since BP
debating involves four teams judges are centrally tasked with comparatively assessing the extent and
importance of the persuasive contributions made by each team Merely repeating or reconstructing a
partner s material whilst of some value is rarely if ever more valuable than actually adding new
arguments or analysis In addition it makes the closing half team s job much easier by potentially
leaving them more material to use to extend the debate 
28 Debating Judging Manual
2 9 Definitions and Models
A model refers to Opening Government s explanation of how the policy they are proposing will be
implemented If the motion requires a model or if the Opening Government team wishes to propose a
model this must be explained in the Prime Minister speech The Deputy Prime Minister may clarify parts
of the model in response to any confusion by the Opposition teams but should not introduce a new model
or new substantive portions of the model Government teams are allowed a level of fiat in proposing their
model this is explained in more detail in Section 2 4 under Policy Motions 
The Opening Government team also has a duty to define the motion Debates are about the motion as
defined by OG not about what other debaters or judges in the room thought the words in the motion
meant The definition forms the subject matter of the debate If the motion This House would privatise
education is defined as making all universities independent companies a fair definition then that is
what the debate is about for the remainder of the eight speeches 
The Prime Minister should ensure the debate is adequately defined 
The definition should be at the level of generality implied by the motion It is legitimate for OG to
exclude marginal and extreme cases we re banning cosmetic surgery like the motion says but not for
burns victims It is not legitimate to include only marginal and extreme examples we re banning
cosmetic surgery like the motion says but only for children If Adjudication Cores wish a debate to be
narrowed down in some specific and radical way they will state this in the motion To give another
example if the motion is This House would use community service as a punishment in place of prisons 
and the Government bench states that it will only do this for young non violent offenders this is a severe
and invalid restriction of the motion excluding the considerable majority of cases to which a literal
reading of the motion which mentioned no limits to specific categories of prisoner would seem to apply 
If teams wish to exclude non marginal cases from the debate they must provide a clear criteria on which
cases are excluded and a compelling justification for doing so and their exclusions should not unfairly
disadvantage other teams in the debate Common forms of legitimate restriction include explicitly limiting
or focusing the debate onto broad sets of cases where the motion seems particularly applicable or would
most plausibly be implemented 
For example Government might argue that the scope of the debate is most relevant to countries in the
developing world and provide reasons for suggesting this This is not to say that impacts on countries in
the developed world are considered out of the debate merely that a team has provided reasons why the
debate might plausibly focus on a particular area Again the question in all cases is one of fairness and
consistency with the original motion This is ascertained by asking whether the definition excludes a large
number of cases to which the motion seems to apply and in doing so unbalances the debate If not the
definition is likely to be legitimate Still as a general rule it is sensible for OG teams to avoid restricting
and limiting motions too much 
The definition should not be restricted to a specific time or place Unless the motion specifies otherwise 
it should be assumed to apply to the bulk of the world s states Some motions may presume a certain level
of state capacity for instance the motion This House would allow citizens to sell their votes to others 
29 Debating Judging Manual
will only be relevant in states that are minimally democratic and Opening Government may specify this
without being accused of place setting However teams may not restrict the motion to a particular
location for instance they may not limit the debate to just the United States of America or European
capital cities 
Unless the motion specifies a particular time Opening Government should define the debate as being set
in the present day It is invalid for Opening Government to define the debate as being in some particular
time For example if the motion is This House would allow abortion OG cannot define the debate as
being about whether the judges in the key US case of Roe v Wade should have reached the decision they
did at the time of that case However proposing a specific time scale for a motion does not constitute
time setting provided it keeps implementation reasonably close to the present day So saying we will
allow a two year transition period for businesses to adapt to the proposed changes our policy creates
before we proceed to full implementation is legitimate whereas saying we believe this policy should
eventually be implemented perhaps in one or two decades once all countries will have fully harmonised
to its requirements is not 
Squirrelling
A definition may also be invalid if it is a squirrel A squirrel is a definition of the motion which seeks
to diminish or evade the burden of proof the motion places on Opening Government 
A definition may be considered a squirrel if it is literally inconsistent with the words of the actual
motion that was set If for example the motion is This House would place tolls on all roads and
Opening Government suggests they would place tolls only on major motorways this is clearly invalid 
since the motion specifically says all roads 
A definition may also be considered a squirrel if it is not debatable For instance if the motion is THR
the use of feminist messaging in commercials it would be illegitimate to claim that this debate is only
about negative instances of feminist messaging in commercials as this unfairly limits the scope of the
debate by making it tautological 
If teams make arguments purely based on a squirrel and their squirrel is challenged then their
arguments may be called into question as well However if teams make arguments that may apply to both
the squirreled definition as well as a legitimate definition then their arguments should be judged based
on the content of the argument 
Vague definitions
A vague definition does not clearly answer certain vital questions about what is meant by the motion or
what will happen under the policy the Opening Government team is defending A definition cannot
specify everything and OG is not expected to be exhaustive But common points of vagueness include 
where the debate requires it to function fairly failing to specify exactly what groups of people a policy
applies to the circumstances where it will be implemented the agent who will implement the policy 
or the consequences for those who resist or defy it 
A definition can be vague to different degrees Crucially a vague definition is not an invalid definition 
it just undermines the persuasiveness of OG to the degree that it is unclear exactly what they are
proposing to do The proper response from Opposition teams is to identify this vagueness and its impact
on the debate via POIs or in their speeches Later government speakers can then provide more detail on
30 Debating Judging Manual
what government plans to do provided that this is principally consistent with and does not substantively
change the model provided in the PM though this does not eliminate the fact that it would have been
better had the Prime Minister done so 
Beyond prompting requests for clarification from the Opposition or criticism from them for the policy
being vague and unclear there is nothing more that should arise from a vague definition Opposition
might choose to argue that given that the motion has been vaguely specified a certain reasonable
consequence or interpretation might be inferred from it But they are not permitted to ignore the
definition that was made replace it with a preferred definition of their own choice or claim that since
they haven t defined the motion clearly OG are committed to defending very unreasonable applications
of their policy 
To the extent that a Government team gains an advantage over another team because a previously vague
policy has been later clarified or refined in a way that impairs their Opponents ability to respond that
advantage should not be taken into account by the judges 
Worked Example This House would allow prisoners to vote 
Example 1 
Prime Minister We define this motion as allowing prisoners the right to take part in elections 
Opposition Leader The Prime Minister has failed to confine this motion to adults in prison Thus we
must assume that children who are imprisoned will be allowed to vote which is wrong as children are
unfit to vote 
Deputy Prime Minister That s clearly silly Obviously child prisoners won t be allowed to vote 
The judge should conclude The Deputy Prime Minister is correct The assumption made by the
Opposition Leader is unreasonable and must be rejected The OO team receive no credit for their
challenge 
Example 2 
Prime Minister We define this motion as allowing prisoners the right to take part in elections 
Opposition Leader The Prime Minister has failed to tell us which sorts of prisoners are allowed to
vote This definition is illegitimate because it doesn t tell us which and that might include
murderers 
Deputy Prime Minister That s silly Of course our model doesn t extend to murderers and the like that
would be completely unreasonable 
The judge should conclude Neither the Deputy Prime Minister nor the Opposition Leader are correct 
There was nothing wrong with the Prime Minister s definition it merely left the opportunity for the
Opposition teams to make arguments about why allowing murderers to vote would be a bad idea It is not
obvious that murderers were excluded from Prime Minister s definition nor is it clear that they should
be 
31 Debating Judging Manual
Challenging the Definition
If the definition provided by the OG is invalid then it can be challenged This must be done during the
Opposition Leader s speech As stated the only grounds for claiming that a definition is invalid is if it
meets one of the two squirrelling circumstances outlined above or if it unfairly restricts the time and
place of the debate It is not enough for a definition to not seem in the spirit of the motion or for a
definition to have not been expected by other teams in the debate 
If a team challenges the definition they must argue that the definition is illegitimate and
explain why In challenging the definition the Opposition Leader has two choices 
1 Firstly they can complain about the motion having been defined in an invalid way but proceed to
debate it anyway This is preferable if the motion proposed is not a fair reading of the motion but
is still debatable The debate then proceeds and is judged as per normal 
2 Secondly they can challenge the definition and redefine it They should tell the judge and the
other debaters what a proper definition would be and should then proceed to argue against that
case Where a team takes this option it is advisable in some cases though not required for them
to present even if analysis engaging with the OG s definition of the motion and the material that
stems from that definition as well as their own 
Judges should not punish teams just for having a definitional debate However if teams engage in
unnecessary definitional debates over reasonable definitions this should be treated as self penalizing as
they are wasting time on unpersuasive material at the cost of relevant arguments 
In extremely rare cases Opening Government may propose a wholly undebatable definition If the
Opposition Leader neglects to challenge the definition other Opposition speakers may challenge this
definition In these scenarios it is advisable for Closing Opposition to offer Points of Clarification to
Opening Government These scenarios are exceedingly rare and teams should be aware that
attempting to challenge the definition when the motion is not wholly undebatable is likely to harm
them Teams should not pursue this strategy lightly 
If the definition is challenged judges must weigh the contributions teams made to the debate based on
the accepted definition at the time they gave their speeches To illustrate this consider the following
scenario Say for instance that Opening Government and Opening Opposition agree on a definition and
Opening Opposition clearly win the top half debate based on this accepted definition Closing Government
and Closing Opposition agree to expand the definition of the debate and make contributions to the
debate based upon the expanded definition Judges cannot then disregard Opening Opposition because
 the debate became about something else rather they must compare the relative contributions
that each team made to the round and consider moments where front half teams engage with back
half teams and vice versa 
Please bear in mind that definitional challenges are incredibly rare and more a last resort than a
first line of defence against a Government case Where a definition falls within one of the circumstances
outlined above it is often still advisable for a team to debate the motion as it has been defined and
avoid the procedural complexity of a definitional challenge taking away from their time to present
substantive arguments 
32 Debating Judging Manual
Note that a definition cannot be attacked merely for being the status quo Most motions will ask
Government to defend the implementation of some sort of policy which is likely to involve changing the
world from the way it is at present As such if OG actually propose something which is identical to the
status quo this might be symptomatic of them failing to define the motion properly 
But as Worlds is an international tournament with motions presumed to apply to many different
countries which each have different existing policies the mere fact that a definition is status quo in
some context is not a problem with the definition For example if the motion is This House would only
have unicameral single chamber legislatures and OG propose that all democracies should have a
single chamber parliament elected through a mix of constituency representatives and proportionate
party list members they have proposed a policy which is the status quo in New Zealand However this
would be a radical change for many democracies Defining a debate in a way that happens to be status
quo somewhere is not in and of itself a problem 
Whether a definition is valid or not it is not the job of the judge to attack the definition and judges
should only worry about the definition if teams in the debate do If the definition is successfully attacked
as being vague OG should be penalised only to the extent to which a lack of detail prevents teams from
making arguments Other teams should not be penalized for OG s vagueness judges should allow other
teams to advance fair and reasonable assumptions so long as they reasonably and logically follow from
OG s vague definitions 
Worked Examples This House would allow prisoners to vote 
Example One 
Prime Minister We will allow all prisoners to vote in elections who have less than one week
remaining in their prison sentence 
Opposition Leader This is clearly unfair as a definition of the motion as it unduly narrows the scope of
the debate but we ll oppose it anyway 
The judge should conclude The Opposition Leader has made a correct challenge to the motion and the
Prime Minister should be penalised 
Example Two 
Prime Minister We would allow all wrongfully accused prisoners to vote having released them from
prison 
Opposition Leader This is a completely unacceptable narrowing and twisting of the definition to the
point where the Government have not argued that real prisoners should be allowed to vote Since what
they need to prove is that actual prisoners should be allowed to vote that is what we will be arguing
against We oppose such a policy for the following reasons 
The judge should conclude The Opposition Leader has done the right thing by replacing the unworkable
definition with a workable one Teams should follow the Opposition Leader s lead and debate the motion
as they have set forth 
33 Debating Judging Manual
2 10 Opposing the Debate
So Government argues in favour of what the motion requires them to do or say is true What about
Opposition In a debate about a policy the Opposition must say that we shouldn t do it that is that
something is better than doing this policy So as with definitions of the debate by OG the position
Opposition choose to defend can be the status quo in some countries it can be something which is
currently done nowhere or it may be described as doing nothing rather than doing the policy though
naturally teams doing this don t necessarily recommend wholesale government inaction but are running
the comparative line that whatever other broadly sensible relevant policies one is carrying out the
addition of this one makes things worse 
Counterpropping
So long as Opposition provide reasons not to do the policy this is fine It is not Opposition s burden to
commit themselves to a particular or specific alternative course of action to the Government policy 
However they may choose to advance a counter proposition this refers to a specific policy or
model promoted by the Opening Opposition see Section 2 7 on Motion Types for more information
about policy debates This course of action should only be undertaken when the motion type allows
for a policy debate 
Just as only the OG has the right to set out a model for the Government side and must do so in the
Prime Minister s speech only the Opposition Leader may set out a counter proposition for the
Opposition side When advancing a counter proposition Opening Opposition teams enjoy the same
level of fiat as Opening Government 
The counter proposition proposed by the Leader of Opposition must be mutually exclusive with the
model proposed by the Prime Minister It is important to note that a counterprop alters the
comparative in the debate as all teams need to compare the policy proposed by the Government
with the counterprop rather than with status quo The debate is judged as per normal teams
advance arguments about the benefits and harms of both proposed models 
For example on the motion THW significantly increase taxes for individuals in the highest income
bracket Opening Opposition may counter prop abolishing income taxes instead a policy which is
mutually exclusive to Opening Government s model It would however not be a counter prop for Opening
Opposition to claim that they would educate individuals about philanthropy as this is not mutually
exclusive to the Opening Government model 
Opening Opposition does not need to advance a counter proposition and can still win the debate by
arguing against the model proposed by the government e g by arguing that OG s model will make the
problem so much worse that inactivity is preferable or showing that OG s action will create a different 
even larger problem 
Worked Examples This House would invade Syria 
Example One 
Prime Minister We believe that the United States should invade Syria at once and install a new
government 
34 Debating Judging Manual
Opposition Leader We believe that the United States should invade Syria at once but they should
also give economic assistance to a new Syrian regime 
The judge should conclude OO s counter prop is not mutually exclusive with OG s and indeed accepts
the premise of the OG s case OO is not actually opposing the motion 
Example Two 
Prime Minister We believe that the United States should invade Syria at once and install a new
government 
Opposition Leader Rather than invading the US should give military aid to rebel groups within
Syria 
The judge should conclude OO s counterprop is not strictly mutually exclusive with the OG s case but
they have set it up as an alternative in effect saying that we suggest the model of a not invading and b 
giving military aid Depending on the arguments that follow they may be able to successfully show that
their model is preferable to OG s though it is valid for OG to accept the alternative argument as part of
their own model 
Alternatives
Arguments that suggest a range of viable alternative arguments and solutions are not the same as
advancing a counter proposition 
Opening Opposition also has the right to point to a variety of possible superior alternatives without
committing to a counter proposition However this is not the same as advancing a counter prop 
a Providing a range of possible alternatives is not the same as providing a specific mechanism that
the Opposition bench as a whole must commit to whereas a counter prop is a specific mechanism
that CO must abide by 
b Opposition teams do not have fiat power when advancing alternatives and Government teams
may question the feasibility of suggested alternatives 
c Providing a range of possible alternatives may affect the persuasiveness of OG s arguments but
does not necessarily alter the comparative in the debate whereas a counter prop alters the
comparative in the debate
Alternatives like any other argument must be proven superior in order to be winning lines Their mere
existence is not sufficient for the team advancing the alternatives to win Winning alternatives should be 
a Detailed and substantiated vague and unsubstantiated alternatives are evaluated in the same
way vague and unsubstantiated arguments are i e they are found to be unpersuasive 
b Mutually exclusive to OG s model otherwise they should be evaluated similarly to all other
non exclusive material in the round i e bad material 
For example if Opening Opposition claims only that they can regulate this will be significantly less
persuasive than explaining how they might regulate and why this regulation is likely to be effective 
Similarly if Opening Opposition claims This money can be better invested in other areas like hospitals
or charities this argument is unpersuasive unless OO can explain both why the money cannot be
invested in these areas in OG s case and why the money is likely to be invested in those areas

2 11 Member Speeches Extending the Debate
The Government Member and Opposition Member are each responsible for extending the debate An
extension is defined as anything that hasn t yet been said by that side of the debate An extension can
take a number of forms including 
 new arguments which have not yet been made in the debate 
 new rebuttals to material raised by the other side 
 new examples or case studies 
 new analysis or explanation of existing arguments 
 new applications of existing argumentation e g if the Member points out that one of their
opening half s arguments is able to defeat a new argument from the other side 
 new criteria for judging the debate or a new defense of existing criteria for weighing arguments
In short saying almost anything other than a word for word repetition of first half s material will in
some sense constitute an extension In that sense role fulfilment here is fairly easy and most
extension speakers will succeed in fulfilling the bare minimum requirements of their role There should
be almost no instances of a team on closing half adding no new material whatsoever 
However a closing team can only be credited for contributions to the debate that go beyond what has
already been contributed by their opening half Closing teams do not win through minimal additions to
already well substantiated points but to the extent to which their contribution including the summary is
meaningfully better than what has come before A closing team that contributes only the most minimal of
extensions is unlikely to have contributed more persuasive material than their opening As a result closing
teams do not defeat their opening half team merely by having an extension any more than OG teams
win the debate for having a model A winning extension will bring out material that is most able to
persuade the judge that the motion should be affirmed or rejected 
If certain arguments have already been convincingly won by the analysis of an opening half team a team
which merely adds new analysis to those arguments may be able to on the basis of that analysis defeat
the teams on the opposing side but is unlikely to have provided good grounds on which to beat the team
ahead of them When judging the cases of closing teams judges should identify what is exclusively new
coming from the Closing case and then compare only exclusively new material to the Opening case or to
any other team in the debate 
Knifing
Closing teams should be consistent with their opening teams for further clarification refer to 2 4 under
the section Contradictions 
There are some rare exceptions in which closing teams do not have to be consistent 
1 The opening team has conceded the debate or made an extremely damaging concession that
makes the debate impossible to win from their side 
2 OG has squirreled the motion or OO has made an invalid counter prop 
3 The opening team has made a clearly false factual statement that an ordinary intelligent voter
would recognize as false e g in a debate about space travel claiming that the moon is made
out of cheese 
36 Debating Judging Manual
To be clear under these rare circumstances closing teams still have to be consistent with other things
said by their opening this is not a blank cheque to ignore everything that an opening team has said 
just the parts that it would be implausible to expect a closing team to defend To reiterate these
cases are extremely rare and we would not expect teams to invoke these clauses 
Furthermore proposing a different metric by which the debate should be evaluated does not usually
constitute a knife For example if OO claimed that the most important thing in the debate are human
rights it is permissible for CO to claim that geo political impacts are in fact more important If this was
not the case it would make it unfairly difficult for closing teams to meaningfully extend over their
opening 
2 12 Whip Speeches
A good Whip speech will note the major disagreements in the debate points of clash between the two
sides and will make use of the best arguments from each team on their side to make their case that the
motion ought to be affirmed or rejected A whip speaker may in line with their team s need to
contribute more persuasive material to the debate than their opening also explain why their own team s
contributions are the most persuasive or important on their bench though they should do so without
contradicting their opening half s arguments 
Neither whip speaker should add new arguments to their team s cases This is true regardless of
whether the whip speaker is in Government or Opposition In this case new arguments refer to any
material which changes the direction of the case from the extension speech entirely new reasons to do
things claims that new things will happen or claims of new moral truths More detailed examples of
what constitute new arguments are provided in Section 2 11 on extensions and member speeches 
The following things do not count as new arguments in this sense and are permissible for Whips to engage
in 
 new defences of arguments already made
 new explanations of previously made arguments
 new rebuttal
 new examples to support existing arguments
 new explanation regarding the impact or prioritization of existing lines of argumentation and
 anything the other side can reasonably be expected to understand that team intended from
their Member speech 
At times it s difficult to assess the difference between new rebuttal and analysis which is permitted and
new arguments which are not Judges should consider whether or not the making of the claim raises a
new issue or approach to winning the debate on an existing issue to which the other side has little if any
ability to respond 
If a team does make a new argument in the Whip speech judges should simply ignore it and not
afford it any credit Adding new arguments shouldn t be penalised beyond this rather the judge
removes the advantage afforded by the rule violation by ignoring the new material presented 
37 Debating Judging Manual
2 13 Equity
As well as following the rules of BP debating Worlds also requires that all participants adhere to the
tournament Equity Policy Judges have no authority to enforce the equity policy but must obviously
themselves follow it Judges may not cut off a speaker for a perceived breach of equity except in the
most extreme of situations where an equity violation is severe enough to already have disrupted the
round and intervention is required to restore order 
Judges should not take the fact that they believe an equity violation has occurred into account when
assessing who won a debate or what speaker points to award Judges are there to judge the debate and
should only penalise equity violations to the extent to which they make a speaker unpersuasive and or
are unfair on other teams or speakers Judges cannot award a speaker zero speaker marks or give their
team an automatic fourth on the basis of a breach of equity 
To resolve equity violations formally debaters and or judges should report them to the equity team who 
in consultation with the Adjudication Core and the person making the complaint will decide what course
of action if any needs to be taken However being an objectionable speaker is generally not persuasive
to the ordinary intelligent voter A speaker who engages in for example racist behaviour is likely to be
rendered less persuasive overall as a result of that material 
Equity violations are not a standard part of debating that should be expected from time to time On the
contrary they should never occur at a tournament Debating is here for the enjoyment of participants 
and not really worth people falling out with each other over

3 Additional Notes for Judges
Most of the information on how to judge debates and determine results was provided in Chapter 2 as
such all judges must read Chapter 2 of this manual for guidance on judging This section simply
focuses on a few additional issues of a largely administrative nature for judges such as how to actually
engage in the judging deliberation fill in the ballot deliver feedback to the debaters and so forth 
3 1 Deciding the Results
Once the debate has finished the debaters should leave the debate room and the judges should
collectively rank the four teams in order first second third and fourth Judges do this through a
discussion or deliberation aimed at consensus they do not simply each make up their minds and
then vote or engage in a battle with each other to win the discussion Judging panels are a team and
all members of the panel should view themselves as such their job is to cooperatively decide on the
best way to rank the four teams in the debate Debates cannot result in a draw one team must take the
 first one team the second one team the third and one team the fourth 
To repeat the core BP debating criterion on winning debates judges assess which teams were most
persuasive with respect to the burdens their side of the debate is attempting to prove within the
constraints set by the rules of BP debating Judges should determine which team did the best to persuade
them by reasoned argument that the motion ought to be adopted or rejected The judges do so as the
ordinary intelligent voter within the meaning outlined in Section 2 2 and their assessments are always
holistic and comparative considering all the contributions each team made to the debate in aggregate 
and comparing these to other teams Teams cannot win or lose debates for isolated things they did like
setting up the debate well or contradicting another team on their side 
Crucially there are no such things as automatic fourths or automatic firsts This is a matter of
logical necessity however good or bad something a team does is another team could always do exactly
the same good or bad thing and do something else that made them even better or even worse 
Judges can and must assess how well substantiated arguments are This will inevitably involve some
assessment of the quality of the supporting reasons offered for arguments and as noted in section 2 
seriously implausible claims may constitute weak support for an argument in the eyes of the judges But
judges must exercise the minimum of personal evaluation in making such claims and even seriously
implausible arguments cannot be disregarded entirely by the judge if they haven t been rebutted though
they may have little persuasive value 
In an ideal world teams will engage in extensive responses to each other s well detailed points In most of
the debates that occur in the actual world teams will often talk past each other and leave each other s
points unchallenged Under those circumstances the judge will have to assess not only which arguments
are most important but equally which are most clearly proven Unrebutted points that require the judge
to make some logical leaps are often more persuasive than thoroughly rebutted points and are always
more persuasive than no points at all but are not preferable to a well reasoned argument which rests on
fewer unsubstantiated assumptions What is and is not rebutted is therefore of vital importance to judging
debates 
39 Debating Judging Manual
It is also important to identify correctly the direct engagement between specific teams Just as
Opening Government cannot defeat the Opening Opposition due to constructive arguments that Closing
Government provided similarly Opening Government cannot defeat Opening Opposition due to a
rebuttal provided by Closing Government When comparing specific teams we must take into account
what those teams specifically engaged with and had the opportunity to engage with 
Note that speakers don t have to use the word rebuttal to respond to an argument It may be tidier if
they do but judges should not ignore material that adequately deals with an argument just because the
speaker doesn t point out that it does Equally this doesn t mean speakers should be punished for not
refuting everything some claims do not do any harm at all to the opposite side For example in a
debate about the legalisation of drugs if the government say pink elephants are cute because they
have those nice ears and are a pleasant colour this flawed argument can be safely left unrebutted as
it isn t a reason to legalise drugs There is therefore no need to point out that blue elephants are
obviously more tasteful So too if they said some drugs are less harmful than others this could also
be ignored While it is clearly more related to the debate than the cute pink elephants argument it is
pre argumentative that is it has not yet been given sufficient surrounding words to actually provide a
reason to do or not do the policy The other side can quite happily say yes some drugs are more
harmful than others and move on or just ignore this argumentative non sequitur Often as a judge it
can be tempting to complete arguments for teams that are interesting but pre argumentative Don t 
3 2 Judging Panels
Each judging panel will comprise a single Chair and a number of additional judges termed Wings or
 Panellists It is the responsibility of the Chair to manage the deliberation between the judges in a
manner that allows all judges to participate fully in the discussion and produces a consensus decision and
completed results sheet known as a ballot within the deliberation time limit 20 minutes at this
Worlds Chairs of panels must manage their time accordingly and recognise that the rules require a vote if
no consensus has been reached early enough for the adjudication to complete in 20 minutes Taking into
account the time taken to decide on individual speaker points this means you should consider a vote
around 17 minutes into a discussion 
The opinions of Wings count just as much as the opinion of the Chair the main difference is simply that
Wings are just not tasked with chairing i e managing the discussion Wings should treat the Chair with
respect and not interrupt speak over them If wings feel they are not being allowed to meaningfully
participate in the discussion or have concerns about the way in which they were treated by chairs they
should report this to the CAs via the judge feedback form or to the Equity Officers if necessary They
should however also be aware that Chairs are constrained by the time limit and so may not be able to
allot them as much time to speak as they might like In return Chairs should respect the opinions of Wings
and give them sufficient opportunity to contribute to the discussion 
After the time has elapsed the judges must vote on the rankings they disagree over with the
majority in each disagreement determining the result If a panel has an even number of judges and the
result of a vote is tied the Chair s casting vote breaks the tie i e whichever side of the tie the Chair
was on is the final result 
40 Debating Judging Manual
Trainee Judges
Some judges in the tournament may be designated as trainees Trainee judges function exactly like
Wing judges in every respect except that they do not get a vote in the eventual determination of the
round s results Trainee judges do still get to participate in the deliberation and should follow make
notes on and declare their views rankings of the debate Chair judges should give them equal
opportunity to voice their views and other judges should engage with them in discussion directly But the
trainee does not get a say in deciding on the ultimate results of the debate nor are they allowed to cast
a vote in the event that there is no consensus among the panel Being designated a trainee should not
be read as indicating that the Adjudication Core thinks a judge is bad More usually it reflects that either
the judge has limited judging experience or that the Adjudication Core lacks information on the judge 
Chair Wing and Trainee designations may change over the course of the tournament as the Adjudication
Core gains more information about the judge in question either through feedback from teams and
panelists or through judging with them 
3 3 Managing the Discussion
In close rounds it is to be expected that the judges on the panel may have different views on the
debate Therefore achieving consensus and filling in the results ballot in 20 minutes is a difficult task 
requiring careful management by the Chair Here we sketch some suggestions for how this could be
managed These are not strict requirements it is up to the Chair to manage the discussion in an
effective way 
It is reasonable to take a few minutes to organise notes and confirm opinions individually prior to
starting discussion The Chair should then ask each Wing to give either a full ranking of the four teams
or at least some indication of which teams they considered better or worse than each other If Wings
do not yet have a complete ranking they should feel free to provide more general intuitions e g 
 top half bottom half Government bench Opposition bench 8
This is not binding it is a working hypothesis which will evolve as the discussion progresses Wings
should not feel any pressure to agree with one another or the Chair in their initial call as there is no
negative consequence or inference for changing your call 
The Chair should then assess the level of consensus which exists There are many possible combinations 
but thankfully a few scenarios crop up fairly often 
a Everyone has exactly the same rankings have a brief discussion to ensure rankings are the same
for similar reasons Move on to scoring 
b Everyone has the same except 1 person ask them to defend their position Be specific tailoring
the requested defence to the difference between the minority and majority opinion If it is a
difference of one team focus on that team etc 
8That said it is important that comparisons between teams be pairwise That is if two teams are being compared the
contributions of another team are not relevant in this comparison For example a strong Closing Government team will not
strengthen the position of Opening Government if they are losing to Opening Opposition 
41 Debating Judging Manual
c There is similarity in rankings but also some crucial differences You agree on where 1 team is
ranked or some relative rankings everyone agrees OG is better than CG Begin by establishing
which discussions need to happen i e there is disagreement about whether OO beat OG Begin
by consolidating the consensus that exists and use this as a platform to break deadlocks 
d Chaos There is no similarity between the rankings Guide a discussion of each team s arguments 
or depending on what makes sense to you and in context of the clashes between particular pairs
of teams These debates often hinge on how one argument was evaluated so your aim is to detect
such differences in interpretation The initial discussion is intended to inform each other of your
perspectives and find some level of common understanding If two judges believe different
arguments are central frame a discussion about their relative priority Get each judge to explain
their position and attempt to establish a metric for the importance of arguments in the debate 
After this brief discussion rank the teams and compare again If you have achieved some overlap 
move on to the suggestions under c above Vote if necessary 
In all deliberations judges should not feel under any obligation to stick to their original call just
because it was their initial view flexibility and open mindedness in the discussion is crucial and
deliberations should always aim at consensus Such consensus is not however an ideal that is to be
placed above the right result 
As such judges should not trade results in order to each get their own views somewhat
represented in the final ranking this is likely to produce a result that is impossible to coherently
justify If a judge believes that a team placed first and the other judges disagree the former judge
should try to advance their reasons All judges must be flexible and willing to be persuaded but if they
are not persuaded they should stick with what they believe to be right 
Please note that whilst achieving a consensus is ideal it is not always possible Opinions may not change
or the time it would take to change them is longer than the time allocated A split may at some points be
a more accurate evaluation of what happened in the debate Do not make decisions based on untidy
compromises but do not fear to call a vote on issues During feedback we expect you to explain the
decision to use votes to the debaters and how the outcome of these votes affected the final call 
3 4 Filling in the Ballot
Decide the ranking first with no consideration of speaker marks until this has been established This
reflects the fact that teams win debates not speakers and they win based on their aggregate
contribution We are not evaluating our aesthetic appreciation of the speeches or proxy marking team
balance we re assessing the team s aggregate contribution Imbalance within a team should be
reflected by giving the speakers different speaker marks 
Once a ranking has been decided upon the Chair should lead the panel in filling in the ballot This
involves recording the rankings and assigning speaker scores a score from 50 100 for each speaker in
the debate The speaker point scale with guidelines on how to award speakers is attached as an
appendix to the end of this manual There are a few important rules about awarding speaker scores 
 Speaker scores are allocated on a consensus basis 
Speaker scores should reflect the majority decision of the judges not be a compromise between
various opinions i e don t say we think OG wins but we can make sure the speaks reflect your
42 Debating Judging Manual
different view If the majority doesn t think a relative ranking is close there is no reason that
the speaker scores suggest otherwise 
 The combined speaker scores for the two speakers on each team must be compatible with the
ranking they received 
The team that placed first must have a higher combined speaker score than the team that placed
second the team that placed second must have a higher combined speaker score than the team
that placed third and so on Teams cannot be given the same total speaker score there must be
at least a one point difference in the total speaker score of each team 
 Chair judges must ensure that sufficient time is left to award the speaker points with care 
Speaker points are important They are used to determine where teams with the same total team
points rank after the in rounds As such many teams may break or fail to break on the basis of
the speaker points they have been awarded There are also various speaker prizes Therefore 
judges should consider the awarding of speaker points carefully and endeavour to stick as closely
as possible to the speaker point scale 
 Speaker points only successfully distinguish in the final rankings if the overall pool of judges uses
them with some consistency 
There is no metaphysical truth about what an 82 scoring speech for example looks like judges
must stick to the standards of the overall judging pool as represented in the speaker scale rather
than to their own personal standards 
 Judges should not be afraid to use the full range of the scale where it is warranted but speeches
should be exceptionally good or exceptionally weak to achieve markets in the very top and
bottom brackets 
At Worlds we would generally expect to see some marks awarded in virtually every bracket of the
speaker scale The average standard of speech at the tournament is meant to receive a 75 and
the majority of marks will fall in the 70s high 60s and low 80s But at most Worlds we would
expect there to be a number of marks in the high 80s and low 60s and a very small number of
marks in the 50s or 90s 
 Judges should assess all speakers in a fair manner and must take note of the fact that neither
language proficiency nor accent influence a speaker s speaker score 
Bias on the basis of an individual s language status and or cultural background will not be
tolerated by the Adjudication Core and will negatively impact one s judge ranking 
3 5 Announcing the Result
The chair of the panel delivers the adjudication speech In the case that the chair loses a vote and feels
unable to justify the call they may retire from this position and require one of the wing judges who
voted in the majority to deliver all or part of the adjudication If the chair chooses to give the
43 Debating Judging Manual
adjudication this must be to defend the majority position although the chair should overtly state they
disagreed with the majority 
The adjudication should distinguish between the reasons for the decision and advice for teams judges
may give both The reasons should be about what did happen while advice is about what didn t
happen but perhaps should have The latter cannot be a basis for the former 
The primary aim of an adjudication speech is to convey to the teams the reasoning of the panel in
ranking the teams as they did The speech should therefore present a logical argument for the ranking 
using as evidence the arguments made in the debate and how they influenced the judges Debates
shouldn t be judged according to coaching styles either prescriptive styles like problem solution or
decompositions of persuasiveness like content style strategy 
Structuring an Oral Adjudication
Step 1 Announce the ranking of the teams and explain the structure of your adjudication
By way of example a chair judge may say 
 Thank you all for that debate we thought it was excellent I will begin by giving you the call I
will then explain why each team beat or did not beat every other team in the round I will then
provide some general feedback For the sake of time I will not be providing much individual
feedback during this adjudication however please do come speak to me or any of wing judges 
names for more feedback after the round 
The panel was in agreement on all four positions The win went to Opening Government the
second to Closing Government the third to Closing Opposition and the fourth to Opening
Opposition 
Step 2 Explain the ranking of the teams
Go through the teams in an order that makes sense comparing pairs of teams and explaining why one
beat the other Typically this will mean going chronologically beginning with OG and ending with CO or
in the order of the decision starting with either the first or fourth place team 
Comparing teams involves more than making isolated statements about Team X and Team Y and saying
 so X clearly beat Y It requires that you explain the interaction between the teams to establish who had
the better arguments 
Be specific and be detailed the vague application of adjectives is not sufficient judging see Section 3 6
for examples Identify arguments whether and how they were responded to and what the impact of the
remainder was Identify which teams get credit for what and how this influenced your decision about
whether or not we should support the motion 
One effective way to give feedback on an argument or area of clash is to discuss the contribution of each
team on that point in chronological order In other words discuss first the contribution made by first
proposition then the contribution made by first opposition and then explain why one was more
persuasive than the other and the factors that went into that decision Judges are not required to follow
this format but they are required to be comparative and specific 
44 Debating Judging Manual
To continue the illustrative example detailed above using the sample motion THW sack all CA teams
and replace with automatic big data motion generators 
 Going through the debate chronologically to explain the call we identified four clashes between
Opening Government and Opening Opposition these were 1 Is it legitimate to sack CA teams 2 
Will sacking CA teams lead to better motions 3 Will sacking CA teams lead to better judging and
4 Will this lead to CA teams being paid 
Looking at clash 1 is it legitimate to sack CA teams Opening Government have two claims 1 
The main obligation of tournament organisers is to run a good tournament and 2 CA teams have
implicitly consented to being sacked in certain situations Dealing with the first of these claims to
begin with we found the analysis around the point that participants give up much time and
money to attend a tournament which could be ruined by terrible Adjudication highly persuasive 
Opening Opposition s response to this claim however is clever they accept Opening Government s
analysis but state that CA teams also give up their time and money opportunity cost of time
spent was a good example of this Importantly for the panel they correctly point out there is a
disconnect between the argument Opening Government make and the conclusion that this makes
it legitimate to sack CA teams unfortunately Opening Government do not respond to this in the
Deputy Prime Minister speech and therefore this claim is not able to gain any traction 
We think the second of these claims is also strongly dealt with by Opening Opposition Opening
Government claim 
 We did not think either team spent much time at all on the fourth clash and we were unsure why
this was a relevant consideration in the round so this clash did not impact our decision on who
won the top half debate 
Therefore looking at the top half clash in the round we were not persuaded by Opening
Government s claim that it was legitimate to sack CA teams given the responses Opening
Opposition provided This proved decisive given Opening Opposition s subsequent explanation of
why if it is illegitimate to sack CA teams any benefit of doing so is irrelevant given the
illegitimacy However Opening Opposition were also able to win the second clash persuading us
that sacking CA teams would not lead to better motions Therefore despite Opening Government
winning out on the third clash about better judging their inability to explain either why sacking
CA teams was legitimate or that even if it is illegitimate it is less important than having better
judging at the tournament meant that we felt that Opening Opposition won the top half 
Remember You should aim to explain the rankings in relation to all teams in the debate rather than just
the team directly above and directly behind the team in question That is to say you should explain the
decision behind the rankings of OG OO OO CG CG CO OG CO OG CG and OO CO If time does not
permit focus your justification on the team directly above behind but guarantee you are able to fully
justify any of the comparisons in further feedback should a team ask for it 
Step 3 Provide any general advice on how teams can improve
Advice should be separated from the reasons for your decision this avoids confusing teams about which is
which There are a number of broad areas of advice you may want to give as a judge 
 General advice on how to improve

Step 4 Invite teams to speak to you and or your wing judges after the round for more detailed
feedback
3 6 Some Pitfalls to Avoid in Decision Making and Feedback
What follows is a common set of mistakes that judges may make in determining results and giving
feedback Many of the examples we give on such pitfalls aren t in and of themselves bad feedback 
if followed with further elaboration However such statements are in and of themselves
insufficient 
Dealing in generalities rather than specifics
 We thought that Closing Opposition really brought the case home for us so they won the debate 
 Opening Opposition had some interesting things to say but the analysis didn t get better until Closing
Opposition 
 Opening Government talked about rights but I really didn t find it persuasive 
It s perfectly fine for adjudicators to use general language to introduce their reasons provided that each
general statement is supported by examples of what actually happened No statement of the sorts that
we ve listed above should ever go unsupported by specific examples of the claim being made either
during the deliberation or during feedback 
Failing to judge the debate as it happened
 Proposition never talked about rights in this debate 
 It took until the summation speaker until we heard anything about the economic aspect 
 I really wouldn t have propped it like that 
Judges may have their own opinion as to what the best arguments for each side in the debate will be 
but these are not the criteria on which the debate is to be judged Judges may advise teams that there
were interesting avenues of analysis left unexplored but they may not penalise teams for their approach
to the motion or the things that each team decided to emphasize 
Granting certain classes of arguments undue priority
 Only Opening Government knew the names of major Brazilian cities 
 Closing Government won because their arguments were moral rather than practical 
46 Debating Judging Manual
This judging pitfall takes a number of forms one of which is the fetishisation of the use of specific
knowledge in the making of arguments Teams which make strong arguments buttressed by good
knowledge should be rewarded but not because of the total amount of facts they named but because of
the strength of the arguments which those facts were marshalled in support of A clever use of facts
makes an argument stronger and better it does not make an argument 
A second form of this pitfall is according improper priority to arguments that are of various types e g 
moral philosophical economic practical A principled argument for example is not necessarily better
or worse than a practical one it depends what each argument seeks to prove and how well it does so 
 Penalty judging
 You didn t take any Points of Information so there was no way you could come first 
 We had questions about the mechanism so we put you last 
 Your last point came after six minutes in your speech so that really hurt your team 
A good judge isn t one who tries to find as many reasons as possible to exclude consideration of a team s
arguments and speak instead about the form rather than the content of their contribution If a team
violates the duties of role fulfillment they should be penalised only up to the point of removing any harm
they caused to the debate through failure to fulfill their role The one exception is a failure to take a
point of information which is discussed above in Section 1 4 
Instead of penalizing teams judges should remove the advantages of rule violations 
Beginning a point after six minutes probably means a speaker will have less time to develop it but a
judge should still evaluate how substantial the argument s contribution is to the round A one minute
argument can be just as persuasive in the last minute of a speech as it can somewhere in the middle 
Not taking any POIs means that a speaker s material is to be viewed as less persuasive not excluded from
consideration 
Lack of clarity in a mechanism should be resolved by allowing the opposition teams to make any
reasonable assumptions of their own and letting the debate carry on from there It may also make
Opening Government s case less persuasive if the lack of clarity in the mechanism makes it seem less
plausible that the policy could be carried out or if the ambiguity calls into question some of the policy s
benefits 
If a speaker introduces new arguments in an opposition summation speech these are to be discounted as
though the speaker had said absolutely nothing during that part of their speech 
To put it a different way a lot of mistakes that judges penalise in debates are really just instances
where the speaker s decisions have created an opportunity cost The speaker could have used their time
more effectively perhaps by establishing a clearer mechanism but their failure to do so will make their
speech less persuasive already there is no need to add an additional penalty by double counting the
mistake 
47 Debating Judging Manual
Judging format rather than content
 You should have put your argument about rights first 
 Your team was unbalanced all the good points came from the first speaker 
 You only spoke for five minutes 
Speaking for a certain length of time or placing arguments in a certain order is irrelevant in and of itself 
to which team won the debate Naturally speakers and teams who spend all their time on good
arguments and spend more time explaining more important and more complex arguments will do better
at being persuasive but they succeed because they have made good arguments and have explained those
arguments well not because they spent time on them A speaker can win a debate with a one minute
speech but it s very very hard to do so Similarly sometimes it will make a speech more persuasive to
discuss arguments in a particular order because a later argument builds on the analysis of an earlier
argument Judges may choose to relay these issues in feedback to teams but these should not affect the
outcome of the round 
Swiftly reaching a decision and then finding a justification for it
 We all saw the debate the same way so just come to us each individually for feedback 
 The closing half teams were just much more persuasive and their arguments really stuck with us at the
end of the debate so Opening Government took third and Opening Opposition fourth 
Either as an individual or as a panel it can be tempting to feel at the end of the debate that the result is
really clear and not carefully scrutinise the contributions of the four teams to ensure a clear justification
for that ranking instead rather artificially constructing a justification to fit initial hunches about the
call This is especially likely when all the judges end up with the same ranking and thereby conclude that
they must be correct since they all agreed Judges should always at the end of the debate carefully
review the content delivered by all four teams and ensure that a result emerges from a logical reasoned
justification rather than vice versa 
3 7 Feedback on Adjudicators
Adjudication Cores want to know how judges are doing for two reasons first to ensure they provide the
fairest possible competition by allocating the best judges to chair panels second because judges care
about their success in the tournament and feedback is key to fairly assessing their performance 
There are three types of feedback 
 teams feedback on the judge who delivered the adjudication 
 chairs feedback on wings and trainees 
 wings and trainees feedback on chairs 
Each type is important The only way Adjudication Cores can effectively assess and allocate judges is if
everyone participates in providing feedback

Discussion Entirely incompetent at managing discussion struggles to
consider any views of all members on panel irrelevant and very
counterproductive in oral adjudication

Score General Qualitative Comments
Description
10 Exceptional Accuracy Extremely accurate call reflected through precise
appreciation and very meticulous assessment of close comparisons
between teams reflected through speaker scores comprehensive
recognition of all necessary inter team comparisons 
Reasoning Justification Extremely well justified justification 
evidenced by flawlessly or near flawlessly outlined explanations that are
in depth insightful and nuanced explicit identification and strong
justification for any weighing metrics or assumptions employed in
judging certainly should chair 
Discussion Outstanding contribution to the discussion that reflects
exceptional judgment concerning what is relevant and useful to
discussion with a clear sense of prioritisation highly helpful incisive in
commentary 
9 Excellent Accuracy Very accurate call reflected through appreciation and correct
assessment of close comparisons between teams reflected through
speaker scores comprehensive recognition of most necessary inter team
comparisons 
Reasoning Justification Very well justified justification evidenced by
well outlined explanations that are in depth insightful and nuanced 
good attempts made to justify weighing metrics in judging should chair 
Discussion Valuable contribution to the discussion that reflects good
judgment concerning what is relevant and useful to discussion very
helpful 
8 Very Good Accuracy Accurate call reflected through largely correct judgment
regarding close comparisons between teams detailed recognition of
most necessary inter team comparisons 
Reasoning Justification Comprehensively justified justification 
evidenced by well outlined explanations that are in depth and nuanced 
very occasional slippage into minor assumptions or personal biases in
judging or minor lack of clarity in one or more inter team comparisons

metrics for judging are identified but not explicitly justified high
potential to chair 
Discussion Comprehensive contribution to the discussion that reflects
good judgment concerning what is relevant and useful to discussion very
helpful 
7 Good Accuracy Accurate call reflected through generally correct rankings but
potentially wrong regarding close comparisons between teams careful
acknowledgment of most necessary inter team comparisons in
consideration 
Reasoning Justification Generally well justified justification 
evidenced by well outlined explanations occasional slippage into minor
personal biases and assumptions or minor lack of clarity in some inter
team comparisons has potential to chair 
Discussion Good contribution to the discussion that reflects mostly good
judgment about what is relevant and useful to discussion helpful with
only minor lapses in attention and judgment 
6 Above Accuracy Mostly accurate call although may fail to get close 
Average comparisons between teams correct 
Reasoning Justification Good attempt at justifying decision 
explanations demonstrating some appreciation of key clashes and how
they are resolved occasional slippage into minor or insignificant personal
biases and assumptions lack of clarity in some inter team comparisons 
Discussion Good contribution to the discussion that reflects mostly good
judgments concerning what is relevant to discussion helpful with some
lapses in attention and judgment 
5 Average Accuracy Broadly accurate call that gets the obvious clashes correct 
may fail to produce accurate judgment regarding close comparisons or
may neglect a significant but not substantial part of the debate 
Reasoning Justification Some attempt at justifying decision 
explanations demonstrating some appreciation of key clashes and issues 
regular slippage into personal biases and assumptions some of which may
undermine the quality of the justification lack of clarity regarding
specific inter team comparisons 
Discussion Average contribution to the discussion that reflects some
judgment concerning what is relevant to discussion mostly helpful but
may be unresponsive to prompts or generic at times 
4 Below Accuracy Inaccurate call that nonetheless identifies the obvious 
Average rankings correctly call reflects one or more misunderstandings of the
debate some inability to track important arguments responses 
Reasoning Justification Unsatisfactory attempt at justifying decision 
explanations demonstrate some appreciation of key clashes and issues 
but may not warrant or justify the posited call frequent slippage into

personal biases and assumptions some undermining the quality of the
justification lack of clarity regarding most inter team comparisons 
Discussion Average contribution to the discussion that can be at times
irrelevant sometimes helpful but frequently unresponsive to prompts or
generic 
3 Poor Accuracy Inaccurate call failing to identify one or more of the obvious 
rankings correctly call reflects several misunderstandings of the debate 
some of which may be fundamental some inability to track important
arguments responses 
Reasoning Justification Poor attempt at justifying decision 
explanations demonstrating no appreciation of key clashes and issues 
frequent slippage into personal biases and assumptions most of which
certainly undermine the quality of the justification and severely distort
the results lack of clarity regarding most inter team comparisons 
justification occasionally slips into utter irrelevance 
Discussion Below average contribution to the discussion that reflects
somewhat flawed understanding rarely helpful generic or occasionally
unhelpful commentary 
2 Very Poor Accuracy Wildly inaccurate call that completely fails to identify more
than one of the obvious rankings correctly call reflects several core
misunderstandings of the debate clear inability to track important
arguments responses 
Reasoning Justification Little to no attempt at justifying decision 
explanations demonstrating no appreciation of key clashes and issues 
frequent slippage into personal biases irrelevance and assumptions that
cumulatively undermine the quality of the justification and severely skew
the results lack of clarity regarding most inter team comparisons
Discussion Poor contribution to the discussion unhelpful at times
counterproductive to discussion 
1 Abysmal Accuracy Completely inaccurate call that absolutely fails to identify
more than one of the obvious rankings correctly call reflects a
fundamental and foundational misunderstandings of both the debate and
British Parliamentary debating in general clear inability to track
important arguments responses 
Reasoning Justification Effectively no rationalisable attempt at
justifying decision explanations demonstrating no or deeply erroneous
appreciation of key clashes and issues consistent slippage into
unwarranted personal biases and assumptions that cumulatively
undermine the quality of the justification and severely skew the results 
utter irrelevance 
Discussion Very poor contribution to the discussion highly
obstructionist detrimental to the panel
