Before the DebateThe MotionEachroundhasaspecifictopic,knownasthe‘motion’.Themotionsaresetbyateamofseniorjudgesatthetournamentknownasthe‘AdjudicationCore’(alsoknownas‘CATeam’or‘AdjCore’forshort).TheAdjudicationCorewillannouncethemotionforeachroundofdebates,alongwiththe‘draw’(showingalltheroomsinthetournamentandthepositionsinwhicheachteaminthecompetitionwillbedebatingineachroom)toallparticipants15minutesbeforethedebatesbegin.Ifdebatersareuncertainabouttheliteralmeaningofawordinthemotion,theymayaskamemberoftheAdjudicationCoretodefineitforthem.TheymaynotaskanyoneotherthanamemberoftheAdjudicationCoretoexplainanywordsinthemotion,normaytheyrefertoonlineresources.Theymayalsonotaskforanyfurtherassistancefromthe Adjudication Core beyond a simple definition of the word they are unfamiliar with.Information, Context or Definitions accompanying motionsOn some occasions, the Adjudication Core may release an informational slide, or ‘infoslide’, prior toreleasing the motion. This usually consists of a short explanatory paragraph which can serve severalpurposes, from simple clarifications of words in the motion to giving context and relevant informationabout potential issues in the debate.Information provided in the infoslide should be assumed to be true for the purposes of the debatefollowing it. For example, if the extra information comes in the form of a definition of a word or term inthe motion, this definition should not be disputed in the round following it. However, teams are free toprovide additional definitions, clarifications or contextual information during the debate, on top ofwhatever information is already provided within the infoslide.Preparation TimeAfter the motion is released, teams have 15 minutes to prepare their speeches.During these 15minutes, the two speakers in a team must confer solely with each other while preparing.Receivingassistance from anyone else during prep time, such as coaches, other members from their institutions, orjudges, is strictly prohibited – teams spotted doing this should be reported, and may be penalised bydisqualification from the tournament. Teams mustnot, under any circumstances, use the Internet to1research the motion or to communicate with anyone that is not the CA team, the Organizing Committee,or their partner. However, they may use their electronic devices as stopwatches, or as cameras to takephotographs of the draw, motion and info-slide. They may also refer to electronic (offline) dictionaries.1We hope that no team at Worlds breaches these strict prohibitions. However, if you are a debater, and you witness anotherdebater preparing with someone other than their partner or illegitimately using electronic devices, you should report this to amember of the Adjudication Core, or if they are not available, to any Chair judge or, if no Chair judges can be found, to anyother judge. A judge informed about this should try to visually confirm that the team in question is indeed illegitimatelypreparing with outside assistance/illegitimately using electronic devices (ideally, they should also get another judge to witnessthis). They should then ask the team to provide their team name, and explain that preparing with someone other than yourpartner/using electronic devices for purposes other than timing or as an electronic dictionary is strictly prohibited. They shouldthen (either immediately or after that round of debates is completed) inform a member of the Adjudication Core about theissue.9Debating & Judging ManualThere are no exceptions unless teams receive authorisation in advance from the Equity team, asauthorised by the Adjudication Core, due to special circumstances (such as an access need).2During the 15 minutes of preparation time, Opening Government may prepare in the venue that will beused for their debate. Other teams, observers and judges should not enter the room until the preparationtime is over.Judges should call debaters into the debate room 15 minutes after the motion is announced.Teams mustbe ready to enter the debate room once the 15 minutes has elapsed. Late teams risk being replaced by a‘swing team’ (a specialad hocteam created to replacethem, which is not a fully participating team atthe tournament), which will be summoned if they are not ready to enter the debate room after 15minutes of preparation time. If the summoned swing team has reached the debate room, and the debatehas begun, before the actual team has arrived, then the actual team will not be allowed to participate inthe round, and will receive zero points for that round.Pronoun introductionsBeforethedebatebegins,eachoftheparticipantsintheroomwillbeinvitedtointroducethemselvesand also be given the opportunity to introduce a gender pronoun.Thereisnorequirementtoexpressaparticularpronoun.Chairsshouldmakethisclearwhentheyfacilitate the introductions (of both speakers and adjudicators).For example, chairs might say something like:“Beforewestartthisdebate,wewillgoaroundtheroomandintroduceourselves.Atthattime,youarewelcometostateyourpronounpreferenceifyouwishtodoso.Ifyoudonotwanttostateapronoun,thatisok,andinthatcaseeveryoneelsepleasedefertogenderneutral language”.Asaresult,ifyoudonotfeelcomfortabledisclosingapronounordonothaveapronounyouwishtodisclose, you may simply state your name (and speaker position) as your introduction.If you do wish to state a gender pronoun, an example for doing so is:“Hello, my name is ….. my gender pronoun is …..”Asthechairintroduceseachspeaker,thechaircanremindtheroomofthespeaker’spronoun(ifapplicable).  For example, the chair might say:“I now invite the government member x, pronoun they.”Allparticipantsshouldtakenoteofthepronounofeachspeakerandusethatpronountorefertothem(if applicable).You should not assume anyone’s genderpronoun.Ifyoumistakenlyusethewrongpronoun,pleaseapologise.Disregardforaperson’sgenderpronounmaybe treated as an equity violation.2For the avoidance of doubt, this authorisation does not include use of digital matter files or online communication such as googledocs.10Debating & Judging ManualIfaspeakeroranadjudicatordoesnotintroduceapronoun,allotherparticipantsintheroomshoulduse gender neutral language, e.g. ‘speaker’ or ‘PrimeMinister’ or ‘adjudicator’.1.6 Iron-personingIf,duringanyofthePreliminaryRounds,amemberofateamistakenillandrequiresmedicaltreatment,orarecognisedmedicalconditionprohibitsthemfromparticipatinginagivenPreliminaryRound,theothermemberoftheteamisentitledtoparticipateinthePreliminaryRoundasan‘iron-person’team.Inaniron-personteam,onespeakerdeliversbothspeeches.Thespeakermustprepareontheirown.Injudginganiron-personteam,theAdjudicationPanelshalltreattheteamasiftheywereanordinaryteam,andfillouttheballotaccordingly(indicatingthattheteamwasaniron-personteamontheballot).Therulesrelatingtoiron-personteamsshalloperateatthediscretionoftheAdjudicationCoreandEquityCommittee.Wherethereisadisputebetweenthetwobodiesregulatingiron-personteams,thejudgement of the Equity Committee shall take precedence.Fromtheperspectiveofotherteamsinthedebate,andthejudgingpanel,thisteamofonespeakergivingbothspeechesfunctionsjustlikeanormalteam–theymayreceiveanyrankinthedebatefromfirsttofourth,andwillreceivetwospeakermarks,oneforeachspeech,andotherteamsinthedebatewillbeawardedtheotherranksasnormal.Inthe‘tab’(thetabulatedresultsforthetournament,maintainedroundonroundandusedtodeterminethebreak),however,theabsentspeakerwillreceivezerospeakerpoints,andtheiron-personingspeakerwillreceiveasinglespeakerscore,thehigherofthetwo speeches they gave.Theiron-personingteammaykeeptheteampointsthattheyreceivedduringtheround,andtheseteampointswillbeusedtodeterminethedrawforfuturerounds.Teamsmaystillbreakaslongastheyarenotspeaking as an iron-person team for more than 3 preliminary rounds out of 9.1.7 Breaches of OrderForthedebatetobeabletoproceedproperly,andforallspeakerstohaveafairchancetodelivertheirspeeches,alldebaters(andanyoneelseinthedebateroom)arerequiredtorefrainfromdisruptingthedebate.

If, forexample, a smaller number of ESL teams are present, the ESL break may only be to Semifinals (eight teams); if a larger numberare present, the break may be expanded to include Octofinals (32 teams).13Debating & Judging Manual2. Debating and Judging at WUDC2.1 Winning a DebateTeamsinadebateareallaimingtowinthedebate.Forbothdebatersandjudges,thecentralstatement on how teams win debates is as follows:Teams win debates by

statement:(i)Onecouldstandupinadebateandbepersuasiveaboutanything,butthiswillnothelptowina debate unless it is relevant to the burdens teams are seeking to

More information can be found in the section on counter-propping.Analysis MotionsMotionsthatbeginwith“ThisHousebelievesthat[X]”arevaluejudgmentdebates.TheyrequireGovernmentteamstoargueforthetruthofthestatementrepresentedbyX,whilstOppositionteamsargue that X is false. There is no need for Government teams to implement a model.Take,forexample,themotion“THBTthereisnomoralobligationtofollowthelaw”.Thedebateisaboutwhetherornotthestatementistrue,notaboutwhetherornotthegovernmentshoulddoanythingaboutthestatement(by,forinstance,abolishingalllaws,whichisinanycaseimplausible).Governmentteamsneednothaveamodel;theyshould,however,stilldefinetermswithinthedebate.In this case, they should define what a moral obligation is.Motionsthatbeginwith“THBT[X]should...”areaboutwhetherornotthestatementistruefromtheperspectiveofaneutralobserver.Eventhoughthesemotionsarephrasedastrueorfalsestatements,Government teams are encouraged to implement a model.Takeasanexamplethemotion“THBTtheUSshouldsanctionSaudiArabia.”Whileitispossibleforteamstodebatethemeritsanddemeritsofsanctionsinabstract,thedebatewouldbemademuchclearerifGovernmentteamspresentamodeloutliningwhatsanctionsentail,whatkindsofsanctionswouldbeimplemented,andsoon.Similartopolicydebates,Oppositionmayalsoproposeanalternative(seeSection2.10oncounterpropping).Thesemotionsshouldnotbeconfusedwithactormotions,discussed in the section below.Motionsthatbeginwith“ThisHousesupports/opposes[X]”alsousuallyneednotinvolveGovernmentproposingamodel.Instead,theGovernmentteamsneedtoarguethattheywouldeithersymbolically,politically,materiallyorinsomeothermannersupporttheperson,group,institution,cause,idea,value,or statement expressed by X. Opposition need to argue that X should not be supported in that way.Take,forexample,themotion“THSUSinvolvementintheMiddleEast.”GovernmentteamsmustarguethatUSinvolvementispositiveintotality,withoutpickingandchoosingwhichaspectsofthismotiontheyaresupporting.Similarly,Oppositionteamsmustopposethismotionintotality,withoutpickingandchoosingwhattooppose.TeamscannotsupportonlyfavorableaspectsofUSinvolvement,norcanthey oppose only unfavorable aspects of US involvement.25Debating & Judging ManualSecondly,GovernmentcannotmodelhowUSinvolvementwilloccur.TheycanarguethatUSinvolvementislikelytohappeninacertainway,butthischaracterizationisopentochallengebytheotherteams.In other words, Government has no fiat power in THS / THO debates.Motionsthatbeginwith“ThisHouseprefers”functioninthesamewayasotheranalyticaldebates,withoneimportantdifference:Oppositionteamsareboundtodefendthespecificcomparisonprovidedbythemotion.

analysis motions may be worded: This house believes that X is in the interests of Y. These motions are likely to featuresimilar, and in some cases identical arguments to actor motions.The main distinction between these motions is that, by virtue of their motion type, they will necessarily enliven different burdens.For example, in an actor debate, Opening Government can model how the actor would do X.Additionally, in an actor debate, there may be more argumentation open to teams about the moral beliefs and principles an actorholds, whereas in the alternative motion wording, teams may need to more explicitly analyse why those moral beliefs andprinciples translate into interests.Finally, it is possible there are rare cases where the actor’s interests from their own perspective, and the actor interests from aneutral observer’s perspective, diverge slightly. For example, this could be in circumstances where the neutral observer hasadditional information that the actor does not themselves have and could not realistically be able to obtain.6A motion worded ‘This house would’ should be treated as an actor motion if it contains an Information Slide describing theperspective of an actor (commonly starting with the wording ‘You are a….’). For example: You come across a button which, ifpressed, will instantly and painlessly erase all of human existence. If not pressed immediately, the button will permanentlydisappear: This house would press the button.27Debating & Judging

There are a number of broad areas of advice you may want to give as a judge:●General advice on how to improve●Suggestions of reasons why things identified in the adjudication happened45Debating & Judging Manual●What might have been run (although please minimise this unless asked)Step 4 - Invite teams to speak to you and/or your wing judges after the round for more detailedfeedback3.6 Some Pitfalls to Avoid in Decision-Making and FeedbackWhat follows is a common set of mistakes that judges may make in determining results and givingfeedback.Many of the examples we give on such pitfallsaren’t in and of themselves ‘bad feedback’if followed with further elaboration. However, such statements are in and of themselvesinsufficient.Dealing in generalities rather than specifics“We thought that Closing Opposition really brought the case home for us, so they won the debate.”“Opening Opposition had some interesting things to say, but the analysis didn't get better until ClosingOpposition.”“Opening Government talked about rights, but I really didn’t find it persuasive.”It’sperfectlyfineforadjudicatorstousegenerallanguagetointroducetheirreasons,providedthateachgeneralstatementissupportedbyexamplesofwhatactuallyhappened.Nostatementofthesortsthatwe'velistedaboveshouldevergounsupportedbyspecificexamplesoftheclaimbeingmade,eitherduring

the economic aspect.”“I really wouldn’t have propped it like that.”Judgesmayhavetheirownopinionastowhatthebestargumentsforeachsideinthedebatewillbe,butthesearenotthecriteriaonwhichthedebateistobejudged.Judgesmayadviseteamsthattherewereinterestingavenuesofanalysisleftunexplored,buttheymaynotpenaliseteamsfortheirapproachto the motion, or the things that each team decided to emphasize.Granting certain ‘classes’ of arguments undue priority“Only Opening Government knew the names of major Brazilian cities.”“Closing Government won because their arguments were moral rather than practical.”46Debating & Judging

arguments;• May occasionally fail to fully respond to very well-made arguments; but flaws in thespeech are limited.10See section 3.4 for more detailed information aboutfilling in the ballot and

Arguments are relevant, and address the core issues in the debate;• Arguments well made without obvious logical gaps, and are all well explained;• May be vulnerable to good responses.76-78• Arguments are almost exclusively relevant, and address most of the core issues;• Occasionally, but not often, arguments may slip into: i) deficits in explanation, ii)simplistic argumentation vulnerable to competent responses or iii) peripheral orirrelevant arguments;• Clear to follow, and thus credit.73-75• Arguments are almost exclusively relevant, although may fail to address one or morecore issues sufficiently;• Arguments are logical, but tend to be simplistic and vulnerable to competentresponses;• Clear enough to follow, and thus credit.70-72• Arguments are frequently relevant;• Arguments have some explanation, but there are regular significant logical gaps;• Sometimes difficult to follow, and thus credit fully.67-69• Arguments are generally relevant;• Arguments almost all have explanations, but almost all have significant logical gaps;• Sometimes clear, but generally difficult to follow and thus credit the speaker fortheir material.64-66• Some arguments made that are relevant;• Arguments generally have explanations, but have significant logical gaps;• Often unclear, which makes it hard to give the speech much credit.61-63• Some relevant claims, and most will be formulated as arguments;• Arguments have occasional explanations, but these have significant logical gaps;• Frequently unclear and confusing; which makes it hard to give the speech muchcredit.58-60• Claims are occasionally relevant;• Claims are not be formulated as arguments, but there may be some suggestiontowards an explanation;• Hard to follow, which makes it hard to give the speech much credit.55-57• One or two marginally relevant claims;• Claims are not formulated as arguments, and are instead are just comments;• Hard to follow almost in its entirety, which makes it hard to give the speech muchcredit.50-55• Content is not relevant;• Content does not go beyond claims, and is both confusing and confused;• Very hard to follow in its entirety, which makes it hard to give the speech any credit.50Debating & Judging ManualAppendix B: Chair Feedback Scale11The mark bands below are rough and general descriptions;judges need not satisfy everyfeature  described to fit in a particular
