      "Introduction: Rules and Guidance\n",
      "This manual is divided into three chapters. Chapter One explains the fundamental format and operation\n",
      "of debates in the British Parliamentary (BP) format used at Worlds. The main chapter, Chapter Two,\n",
      "explains how judges should evaluate debaters and, consequently, how debaters ought to debate. Chapter\n",
      "Three offers some additional notes for judges, covering issues like how the deliberation process works,\n",
      "speaker marks, giving feedback, some pitfalls to avoid, and so on.\n",
      "Ultimately, everything in Chapters One and Two of this manual can be divided into two sorts of\n",
      "statements: Rules and Guidance. Rules are obligatory requirements of BP debating, most of which are\n",
      "found in the WUDC Constitution – breaching these rules is impermissible, though in many cases the\n",
      "infraction might be small, not especially reprehensible, and easily remedied. Many rules strictly prohibit\n",
      "certain practices: for instance, it is not permitted to offer a point of information (POI) later than six\n",
      "minutes into a speaker’s speech. A very small number of such breaches of the rules – offering a POI after\n",
      "six minutes, speaking for longer than 7 minutes and 30 second, or bringing props into a speech, may\n",
      "require intervention by the Chair of the debate (though ideally swift and minimal intervention) to stop the\n",
      "speaker breaching the rules (the chair may, for example, instruct the maker of a POI or the current\n",
      "speaker to sit down and stop talking). We call these ‘breaches of order’.\n",
      "Other rules handle how a Chair should assess features of speeches in determining the relative\n",
      "persuasiveness of teams. Many of these are found in seed form as Constitutional rules, but have been\n",
      "developed by long standing practice and common acceptance into complexes that have elements of both\n",
      "rules and guidance. Examples include appropriate handling of failures to take POIs, consideration of\n",
      "off-putting stylistic features, and assessment of whether an argument has actually been logically\n",
      "persuasive. Breaches of these rules will rarely if ever require any intervention by a Chair, instead they\n",
      "are considered in the judge’s assessment of how persuasive a speaker was when it comes to adjudicating\n",
      "the debate. In other words, the rules specify what can and cannot be done in debaters’ efforts to win\n",
      "debates. They are not optional, though in the vast majority of cases violations of them are small mistakes\n",
      "and should be treated as such, rather than being deemed an outrageous attempt to cheat.\n",
      "At several points this manual makes statements which are not rules but guidance – we have tried to\n",
      "always be explicit in stating that something is guidance rather than a rule. Guidance is general advice on\n",
      "how to succeed in debating. For example, it is sensible, if you want to be persuasive, to structure your\n",
      "speech in certain ways: to explicitly label your points, and to use examples from a range of different\n",
      "cases, for instance. But one doesn’t need to do any of these things to be persuasive or win a debate, and\n",
      "there is no reason why someone who labels their points should necessarily be deemed any more persuasive\n",
      "than someone who doesn’t. Explicitly labelling points will usually help a speaker convey their argument to\n",
      "the judges – but there may be other ways to do this or circumstances in which explicit labelling is\n",
      "unnecessary. Guidance thus constitutes general advice from the authors of this manual to debaters or\n",
      "judges – much like the tips or advice a coach would give – which they are free to follow or abandon as they\n",
      "wish.\n",
      "Crucially, a team should never be penalised, in the judging of a debate, for failing to follow any guidance\n",
      "offered in this manual simply “because it’s the guidance offered in the manual”. Put another way:\n",
      "judges have to judge how persuasive teams are according to the rules, not how well the teams follow our\n",
      "guidance.\n",
      "4 Debating & Judging Manual\n",
      "1. Core Rules of BP Debating\n",
      "1.1 BP Format\n",
      "Each debate will contain four teams, each team consisting of eight speakers.\n",
      "There are two teams on each side of the debate. On one side are Opening Government (OG) and Closing\n",
      "Government (CG), on the other side are Opening Opposition (OO) and Closing Opposition (CO).\n",
      "The two sides of the debate are sometimes called ‘benches’ – as in, ‘the Government bench’ and ‘the\n",
      "Opposition bench’. The first two teams in the debate (OG and OO) are sometimes collectively called the\n",
      "‘opening half’, whilst the third and fourth teams in the debate (CG and CO) are sometimes collectively\n",
      "called the ‘closing half’.\n",
      "Government Bench Opposition Bench\n",
      "Opening Half Opening Government (OG) Opening Opposition (OO)\n",
      "● Prime Minister (PM) ● Opposition Leader (LO)\n",
      "● Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) ● Deputy Opposition Leader\n",
      "(DLO)\n",
      "Closing Half Closing Government (CG) Closing Opposition (CO)\n",
      "● Government Member (GM) ● Opposition Member (OM)\n",
      "● Government Whip (GW) ● Opposition Whip (OW)\n",
      "In the order specified below, speakers from the four teams give their speeches, with each speaker\n",
      "giving one speech:\n",
      "1. First speaker (the ‘Prime Minister’) from the OG team,\n",
      "2. First speaker (the ‘Leader of Opposition’) from the OO team,\n",
      "3. Second speaker (the ‘Deputy Prime Minister’) from the OG team,\n",
      "4. Second speaker (the ‘Deputy Leader of Opposition’) from the OO team,\n",
      "5. First speaker (the ‘Government Member’) from the CG team,\n",
      "6. First speaker (the ‘Opposition Member’) from the CO team,\n",
      "7. Second speaker (the ‘Government Whip’) from the CG,\n",
      "8. Second speaker (the ‘Opposition Whip’) of the CO Team.\n",
      "5 Debating & Judging Manual\n",
      "The debate is presided over by a ‘Chair’, a designated individual who oversees the proceedings of the\n",
      "debate, calling on speakers to speak and enforcing the rules. At Worlds, the Chair will usually be one\n",
      "of the judges – the individuals who will ultimately decide the result of the debate. In the Grand Finals\n",
      "of the tournament, the Chair might be a designated Master of Ceremonies or another designated\n",
      "individual not judging. Each debate will also usually have a timekeeper, who could be the Chair,\n",
      "another judge, or another individual entirely, who times speakers’ speeches.\n",
      "1.2 Length of Speeches\n",
      "Speeches last for 7 minutes. Time signals (usually a bang on the table, ring of a bell, or clap of the hands)\n",
      "will be given by the timekeeper to indicate when 1 minute, 6 minutes and 7 minutes (often indicated by a\n",
      "double clap/bang) have elapsed. Though speakers should ideally finish their speech by 7 minutes, they\n",
      "may legitimately continue to speak in order to finish their sentence or wrap up a conclusion. As a general\n",
      "rule, this shouldn’t take more than a further 15 seconds. Beyond 7 minutes and 15 seconds, judges are no\n",
      "longer permitted to take anything the speaker says into account. The Chair or timekeeper of the debate\n",
      "should bang the table or clap three times at 10 second intervals after 7 minutes 15 seconds to remind the\n",
      "speaker that they are now well beyond their time limit. If the speaker continues speaking past 8 minutes\n",
      "(which should never happen), the Chair of the debate should ‘call order’, and instruct the speaker to sit\n",
      "down.\n",
      "Speakers should start their speech within 1 minute of being called on by the chair of the debate, unless in\n",
      "reasonable circumstances as approved by the chair.\n",
      "1.3 Roles of the Four Teams\n",
      "Each team has a role to play in the debate, and the speakers from that team should attempt to fulfil\n",
      "that role effectively:\n",
      "a) OG should define the motion, advance arguments in favour of their side, and rebut arguments\n",
      "made by OO.\n",
      "b) OO should rebut OG's case (i.e. the general set of arguments they have offered) and advance\n",
      "constructive arguments as to why their side of the table should win the debate.\n",
      "c) CG should provide further analysis in favour of the motion, which should be consistent with,\n",
      "but distinct from, the substantive material advanced by OG. Further analysis can take the\n",
      "form of substantive material, refutation, framing, characterization, or any kind of material\n",
      "meant to advance the Government case.\n",
      "d) CO should provide further analysis against the motion, which should be consistent with, but\n",
      "distinct from, the substantive material advanced by OO. Further analysis can take the form of\n",
      "substantive material, refutation, framing, characterization, or any kind of material meant to\n",
      "advance the Opposition case.\n",
      "More details on these roles can be found in Chapter 2.\n",
      "1.4 Points of Information\n",
      "A Points of Information (POI) is a formalised interjection from any speaker on the opposite side of the\n",
      "table to the speaker who has the floor. It is up to the speaker who has the floor to decide which POIs to\n",
      "accept (i.e. allow to be made) or reject (i.e. not allowed to be made).\n",
      "6 Debating & Judging Manual\n",
      "The first and last minute of each speech is known as ‘protected time’, during which no POIs may be\n",
      "offered to the speaker who is making their speech. During the intervening 5 minutes (i.e. between 01:00\n",
      "and 06:00) points of information may be offered.\n",
      "Teams should take at least 1 POI per speaker, and are strongly encouraged to take 3 POIs across the\n",
      "team - including at least 1 POI from a team on their diagonal (eg. CO taking POIs from OG).\n",
      "A POI may last up to 15 seconds. It can take the form of a comment or a question to the speaker who has\n",
      "the floor. To offer a POI a speaker should, if they are able to, stand and say “point of information,” “on\n",
      "that point” or “point”. They should not offer “coded POIs” by uttering anything which reveals the\n",
      "content of the POI before it has been accepted (by saying, for example “on the law” or “not at all!”). If\n",
      "the POI offered is refused, the speaker who offered it should sit down immediately.\n",
      "POIs may not be offered after the 6 minute mark in a speaker’s speech, and at 6 minutes all speakers\n",
      "currently standing (to indicate that they have offered a POI) should sit down. It is acceptable for a POI\n",
      "which was offered and accepted before the 6 minute mark to continue to be made past the 6 minute mark\n",
      "– it should continue until the POI is concluded, the 15 second time allotment has passed or the POI is cut\n",
      "off. It is also acceptable for a POI offered before 6 minutes to be accepted by a speaker dead on the 6\n",
      "minute mark and then be made. Once all speakers are sitting after the 6 minute mark, no more POIs may\n",
      "be offered or accepted.\n",
      "Speakers may demand that certain speakers or teams stop offering POIs, but it should be of no effect in\n",
      "the mind of the judge or other debaters – all debaters have the right, throughout the times the rules allow\n",
      "in the debate, to offer POIs to speakers from the other side. Similarly, a speaker calling for a POI to be\n",
      "offered does not create any special obligation for a team or speaker to offer a point.\n",
      "Considering POIs in Judging Engagement\n",
      "POIs are an important component in debate rounds. It is the responsibility of judges to track and evaluate\n",
      "POI engagement during the round, which includes but is not limited to: whether or not a speaker was\n",
      "offered POIs, whether or not a speaker accepted a POI, the quality of the POI asked as well as the quality\n",
      "of the POI response. If a speaker has not accepted a POI, judges must remind the room to accept POIs\n",
      "after the speaker has finished speaking. Judges should also comment on POI engagement during their\n",
      "feedback to teams, and will be evaluated on this metric in judge feedback forms.\n",
      "When evaluating speakers that have not taken POIs (assuming sufficient POIs were offered), judges should\n",
      "see a failure to take a POI as indicative of a reduced level of engagement and should take this into\n",
      "account when determining the call. For instance, judges can lower speaker scores for the speaker that did\n",
      "not accept POIs to reflect their reduced level of engagement, adjust the margin of victory for teams, or\n",
      "flip close calls between teams. This DOES NOT mean that a team will take an automatic fourth for failing\n",
      "to take a POI, NOR DOES IT MEAN that they cannot win the debate!\n",
      "If a speaker was offered no POIs, or was only offered one or two POIs at the start of their speech and had\n",
      "no opportunities to take POIs towards the later half of their speech, they will not be penalized for a lack\n",
      "of engagement. (After all, it is difficult to engage when there is nothing to engage with!) A speaker in\n",
      "such circumstances may explicitly ask for a POI, and doing so will demonstrate a willingness to engage\n",
      "with arguments even if no POI is subsequently offered.\n",
      "7 Debating & Judging Manual\n",
      "Failing to take a POI has sometimes been suggested to be equivalent to taking a very damaging POI –\n",
      "this is not an appropriate way to assess this failure. A judge should never give teams credit for\n",
      "arguments that they have not made.\n",
      "In general, judges should evaluate the quality of POIs and POI responses in the same way that they\n",
      "consider any other piece of argumentative or responsive material in the rest of the debate.\n",
      "Cutting off a POI\n",
      "Interrupting a debater who is giving a POI is known as ‘cutting off’. POIs may be up to 15 seconds in\n",
      "length; however, a speaker may cut off a POI before 15 seconds and resume their own speech. Whenever\n",
      "a debater delivering a POI is cut off or their time elapses they must stop speaking, and sit down. If the\n",
      "person offering the POI does not stop speaking after 15 seconds, or after being cut off, the judge should\n",

      "a debate unless it is relevant to the burdens teams are seeking to prove.\n",
      "(ii) The rules of debating constrain legitimate ways to be persuasive. For example, in the absence\n",
      "of rules, the Opposition Whip could often be very persuasive by introducing entirely new\n",
      "arguments, but the rules prohibit this. As such, elements of a speech can only help a team\n",

      "2.2 The ‘Ordinary Intelligent Voter’\n",
      "In most walks of life, persuasiveness is highly subjective – the degree to which we are persuaded by\n",

      "● identifying widely shared moral intuitions in favour of an argument;\n",
      "● exposing a damaging logical implication of a contrasting argument;\n",

      "Contradictions within the same speech or within the same team\n",
      "Teams cannot be credited for two mutually exclusive claims. They may only be credited for the first\n",
      "claim they have advanced. Subsequent claims which contradict or cannot coexist alongside the first claim\n",
      "should not be credited by the judges and opposing teams. This is due to the fact that internally\n",
      "inconsistent teams\n",
      "cannot simultaneously get credit for two areas of mutually exclusive argument.\n",
      "In addition to not crediting contradictory claims, judges may also consider the extent to which the\n",
      "contradiction has undermined the strength of the team’s arguments when determining the team’s\n",
      "contribution to the debate. If either the speaker or the team directly contradicts themselves later in\n",

      "deliberation when determining how plausible their argument is, similar to as if an opposing team offered\n",
      "these arguments in refutation to the speaker. While the later claim should be disregarded, judges should\n",
      "evaluate how the contradiction affected the persuasiveness of the first claim.\n",
      "However, judges should not credit opposing teams unless they point out the contradiction.\n",
      "If a speaker clearly mis-speaks at the start of their speech, and they correct it afterwards, they should\n",

      "2.5 Rebuttal, Engagement, and Comparisons\n",
      "The outcome of the debate should depend on what the teams say. Judges must not intervene in the\n",
      "debate. Do not invent arguments for teams, do not complete arguments, and do not rebut arguments.\n",
      "Engagement from closing half teams should not benefit their opening (e.g. closing half rebuttal should not\n",
      "influence the pairwise comparison between Opening Government and Opening Opposition).\n",
      "We do not automatically dismiss arguments just because we disagree, or because we can see weaknesses\n",
      "in them. Arguments are persuasive and impactful once they are made and substantiated; they become\n",
      "less persuasive and impactful if they are contradicted internally, or responded to by other teams.\n",
      "This has an important implication: if OG, for instance, make arguments where the conclusion is ‘we should\n",
      "do the policy,’ and every other team ignores those arguments, then OG does not lose because ‘the debate\n",
      "moved on from them’. Rather, their unrebutted arguments should still be treated as impactful and should\n",
      "be weighed as such. That does NOT mean that the unresponded-to arguments have a particular effect on\n",
      "the ranking of OG in this example. Judges still need to consider how significant an argument is before\n",
      "deciding how it affects the ranking of teams in a debate.\n",
      "If an argument is clearly absurd (such that you cannot conceive of any Informed Global Citizen believing\n",
      "its logic and/or premises), or it was of marginal importance to the speech of the speaker making the\n",
      "argument, then it is reasonable for a responding team to decide to spend their time elsewhere,\n",
      "particularly where there is other stronger material in the round. Furthermore, judges are entitled to\n",
      "assess how well substantiated an argument is – an argument that is just an assertion (“as we’d all agree,\n",
      "language constructs reality”) without any subsequent substantiation should not receive much credit.\n",
      "There is no absolute duty for a speaker to “hit every argument” from the other side. However, it may be\n",
      "advantageous for other teams to point out and respond to weakly constructed arguments. If major claims\n",
      "go unchallenged by teams, this should be counted as conceded by the team which has passed up the\n",
      "opportunity to respond.\n",
      "Rebuttal consists of any material offered by a speaker which demonstrates why arguments offered by\n",
      "teams on the other side of the debate are wrong, irrelevant, comparatively unimportant, insufficient,\n",
      "inadequate, or otherwise inferior to the contributions of the speaker’s own side of the debate. Rebuttal\n",
      "need not be explicitly labelled ‘rebuttal’ (though it may be sensible for speakers to do so), and it may\n",
      "occur at the beginning, end, middle or through the entirety of a speech. Material labelled as rebuttal can\n",
      "be constructive as well as rebuttal, and material labelled as constructive can also function as rebuttal.\n",
      "21 Debating & Judging Manual\n",
      "Rebuttal does not, therefore, denote some special sort of argument or analysis – it simply refers to\n",
      "any material that engages directly with arguments raised by the other side.\n",
      "Where teams have a chance to rebut each other, assessing relative contributions in this way is easy.\n",
      "Judges should track the argument and assess, given their responses to each other, which team's\n",
      "contribution was more significant in furthering their cause to logically persuade us that we should do the\n",
      "policy, or that we should not.\n",
      "But where teams don't get a chance to rebut others, determining who was more persuasive is trickier.\n",
      "This happens fairly often, for example:\n",

      "● when opening teams are shut out of POIs\n",

      "when judges compare two teams on a diagonal (for example, OG and CO), they should first ask whether\n",
      "anything in the earlier-speaking team’s case is inherently responsive. Did the opening team preempt any\n",

      "However, there are two key ways that a burden can legitimately be attributed to a team (and speakers\n",
      "may legitimately point out such burdens, and explain why they or other teams need to meet them).\n",

      "conditions (though the fact that we do prioritise law-abiding citizens in other cases might be used as\n",
      "evidence of a principle that supports prioritising law-abiding citizens in this case).\n",

      "Policy Motions\n",
      "Motions of the form “This House Would [do X]” involve Government arguing that they should be enacting\n",
      "policy X. A policy is a concrete course of action that Government teams wish to convince the judges\n",

      "that the Government teams set up (also known as Government fiat). As such, it is never a valid line of\n",
      "opposition to such motions to state that “but the government would never do this” or, more subtly, “but\n",
      "politicians would never pass this law”.\n",

      "team has the power to implement such a policy and that this policy will therefore pass the approval of\n",
      "Congress or Parliament; however, the Government team cannot control reactions to this policy, and\n",
      "cannot assume that everyone will behave in a compliant manner once the policy is passed. The question\n",

      "has set out, not just about whether or not cigarettes are good or bad. It is perfectly possible for the\n",

      "For Policy motions, Opposition teams may choose to defend status quo, or propose an alternative in the\n",
      "form of a counter-proposition (see section 2.10). It is not necessary for Opposition teams to present a\n",
      "counter-proposition, though it may be beneficial in some instances.\n",
      "If presenting a counter-proposition, Opposition teams are granted the same amount of fiat power that\n",
      "Government teams have: the debate should assume that whatever counter-proposition Opposition\n",

      "that Opposition’s counter-proposition should not take significantly more resources to achieve than\n",
      "Government’s policy. More information can be found in the section on counter-propping.\n",
      "Analysis Motions\n",
      "Motions that begin with “This House believes that [X]” are value judgment debates. They require\n",
      "Government teams to argue for the truth of the statement represented by X, whilst Opposition teams\n",
      "argue that X is false. There is no need for Government teams to implement a model.\n",
      "Take, for example, the motion “THBT there is no moral obligation to follow the law”. The debate is\n",

      "anything about the statement (by, for instance, abolishing all laws, which is in any case implausible).\n",
      "Government teams need not have a model; they should, however, still define terms within the debate.\n",
      "In this case, they should define what a moral obligation is.\n",
      "Motions that begin with “THBT [X] should...” are about whether or not the statement is true from the\n",

      "Take as an example the motion “THBT the US should sanction Saudi Arabia.” While it is possible for\n",

      "more specific about the entity (A) doing (X) and so invite a closer examination of the perspective of the\n",
      "entity about what they should do, with all teams arguing from actor A’s perspective. Teams debating\n",
      "these motions should therefore consider what actor A’s knowledge, values and interests are, and explain\n",
      "why the motion is or is not in actor A’s best interest. Unlike previously discussed debates7, actor debates\n",
      "are not about whether or not X action is necessarily best for the world.\n",
      "It is important to note at this point that prioritizing actor A’s perspective is not the same as assuming that\n",
      "actor A only cares about their own interests. Most, if not all, actors hold moral beliefs and principles, and\n",
      "will act to actualize those beliefs. Thus, debaters should feel free to make principled arguments in actor\n",
      "debates, in addition to more practical arguments, so long as they are also able to explain why the actor in\n",
      "question holds those specific principled beliefs.\n",
      "Additionally, what an actor should do is different to what the actor is likely to do. For example, whilst\n",
      "past statements of intent help us to understand an actor’s perspective, this does not mean they could not\n",
      "be persuaded to follow a different path.\n",
      "So if, for example, the motion is “TH, as a parent, would not send their child to private school,” this\n",
      "debate should take place from the perspective of a parent, as both the proposed agent to make a decision\n",
      "about the education of their child and the proposed target of argumentative appeals. (By contrast, if the\n",

      "judges of the truth of the statement from a neutral perspective.) In such a debate, Government teams\n",

      "6A motion worded ‘This house would’ should be treated as an actor motion if it contains an Information Slide describing the\n",
      "perspective of an actor (commonly starting with the wording ‘You are a….’). For example: You come across a button which, if\n",
      "pressed, will instantly and painlessly erase all of human existence. If not pressed immediately, the button will permanently\n",
      "disappear: This house would press the button.\n",
      "7Some analysis motions may be worded: This house believes that X is in the interests of Y. These motions are likely to feature\n",
      "similar, and in some cases identical arguments to actor motions.\n",
      "The main distinction between these motions is that, by virtue of their motion type, they will necessarily enliven different burdens.\n",
      "For example, in an actor debate, Opening Government can model how the actor would do X.\n",
      "Additionally, in an actor debate, there may be more argumentation open to teams about the moral beliefs and principles an actor\n",
      "holds, whereas in the alternative motion wording, teams may need to more explicitly analyse why those moral beliefs and\n",
      "principles translate into interests.\n",
      "Finally, it is possible there are rare cases where the actor’s interests from their own perspective, and the actor interests from a\n",
      "neutral observer’s perspective, diverge slightly. For example, this could be in circumstances where the neutral observer has\n",
      "additional information that the actor does not themselves have and could not realistically be able to obtain.\n",

      "their child to succeed materially in life) or principled (e.g. a broad interest in the principle of equality).\n",
      "Opposition teams can do two things: they can either agree with Government teams about the interests of\n",
      "the parent, and argue that the proposed course of action does not meet those interests, or they can argue\n",
      "that parents have different interests than the interests raised by the Government team, and that this new\n",

      "Role fulfilment, in brief, is the name given to the particular duties given to each team on the table,\n",
      "arising because of their particular position, beyond the general duty to “make persuasive arguments”.\n",

      "conveying their reasons for affirming or rejecting the motion. Doing so involves breaking the rules, and\n",
      "cannot entitle them to credit. Role fulfilment is a necessary (but not sufficient!) condition for a team to\n",
      "make persuasive arguments. Incomplete role fulfilment should not be used as the sole justification to\n",
      "fourth teams.\n",
      "The duties associated with role fulfilment are as follows:\n",
      "● For the Prime Minister, to ensure the debate is adequately defined (see Section 2.9).\n",
      "● For the Member speakers (both Government and Opposition), to extend the debate (explained in\n",
      "section 2.8).\n",
      "● For all speakers, to ensure that their arguments are consistent with all other arguments made\n",
      "by themselves, their teammates, and the other team on their side of the debate (see Section\n",
      "2.4 for more information on contradictions).\n",

      "● For all speakers, to speak within the time frame allotted (see Section 1.2 on speech timing).\n",
      "We emphasise here that there is no such thing as an ‘automatic fourth’ or any automatic penalty for a\n",
      "failure to comply with the rules in this document. A team that breaches an element of role fulfilment\n",
      "may still be sufficiently persuasive to beat other teams in the debate; particularly, but not exclusively,\n",
      "when multiple teams in the debate have role fulfilment issues.\n",
      "It is not a role-fulfilment requirement for the Deputy Prime Minister or Deputy Opposition Leader to add\n",

      "debating involves four teams, judges are centrally tasked with comparatively assessing the extent and\n",
      "importance of the persuasive contributions made by each team. Merely repeating or reconstructing a\n",
      "partner’s material, whilst of some value, is rarely if ever more valuable than actually adding new\n",

      "2.9 Definitions and Models\n",
      "A model refers to Opening Government’s explanation of how the policy they are proposing will be\n",
      "implemented. If the motion requires a model, or if the Opening Government team wishes to propose a\n",
      "model, this must be explained in the Prime Minister speech. The Deputy Prime Minister may clarify parts\n",
      "of the model in response to any confusion by the Opposition teams, but should not introduce a new model\n",
      "or new substantive portions of the model. Government teams are allowed a level of fiat in proposing their\n",
      "model - this is explained in more detail in Section 2.4, under “Policy Motions.”\n",
      "The Opening Government team also has a duty to define the motion. Debates are about the motion as\n",
      "defined by OG, not about what other debaters or judges in the room thought the words in the motion\n",
      "meant. The definition forms the subject matter of the debate. If the motion “This House would privatise\n",
      "education” is defined as “making all universities independent companies” (a fair definition), then that is\n",
      "what the debate is about for the remainder of the eight speeches.\n",

      "narrowed down in some specific and radical way, they will state this in the motion. To give another\n",

      "reading of the motion (which mentioned no limits to specific categories of prisoner) would seem to apply.\n",

      "cases are excluded and a compelling justification for doing so, and their exclusions should not unfairly\n",
      "disadvantage other teams in the debate. Common forms of legitimate restriction include explicitly limiting\n",
      "or focusing the debate onto broad sets of cases where the motion seems particularly applicable or would\n",

      "number of cases to which the motion seems to apply, and in doing so unbalances the debate. If not, the\n",

      "The definition should not be restricted to a specific time or place. Unless the motion specifies otherwise,\n",

      "capital cities).\n",
      "Unless the motion specifies a particular time, Opening Government should define the debate as being set\n",
      "in the present day. It is invalid for Opening Government to define the debate as being in some particular\n",

      "various opinions. i.e. don't say “we think OG wins, but we can make sure the speaks reflect your\n",

      "different view”. If the majority doesn't think a relative ranking is close, there is no reason that\n",
      "the speaker scores suggest otherwise.\n",
      "● The combined speaker scores for the two speakers’ on each team must be compatible with the\n",
      "ranking they received.\n",
      "The team that placed first must have a higher combined speaker score than the team that placed\n",
      "second, the team that placed second must have a higher combined speaker score than the team\n",
      "that placed third, and so on. Teams cannot be given the same total speaker score – there must be\n",
      "at least a one point difference in the total speaker score of each team.\n",
      "● Chair judges must ensure that sufficient time is left to award the speaker points with care.\n",
      "Speaker points are important. They are used to determine where teams with the same total team\n",
      "points rank after the in-rounds. As such, many teams may break, or fail to break, on the basis of\n",
      "the speaker points they have been awarded. There are also various speaker prizes. Therefore,\n",
      "judges should consider the awarding of speaker points carefully, and endeavour to stick as closely\n",
      "as possible to the speaker point scale.\n",
      "● Speaker points only successfully distinguish in the final rankings if the overall pool of judges uses\n",
      "them with some consistency.\n",
      "There is no metaphysical truth about what an 82-scoring speech, for example, looks like – judges\n",
      "must stick to the standards of the overall judging pool, as represented in the speaker scale, rather\n",
      "than to their own personal standards.\n",
      "● Judges should not be afraid to use the full range of the scale where it is warranted – but speeches\n",
      "should be exceptionally good, or exceptionally weak, to achieve markets in the very top and\n",
      "bottom brackets.\n",
      "At Worlds, we would generally expect to see some marks awarded in virtually every bracket of the\n",

      "the majority of marks will fall in the 70s, high 60s and low 80s. But at most Worlds we would\n",
      "expect there to be a number of marks in the high 80s and low 60s, and a very small number of\n",
      "marks in the 50s or 90s.\n",
      "● Judges should assess all speakers in a fair manner and must take note of the fact that neither\n",
